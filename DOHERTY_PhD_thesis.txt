Abstract

In this thesis we present a range of observations and results relating to the lensed hyperluminous
sub-mm galaxy ‘9io9’ at z = 2.6, where we have used sub-mm/mm spectroscopy targeting the
dense and cold interstellar medium to better undertstand the conditions underlying extreme star
formation (1000× that of the Milky Way) in galaxies the early Universe.
In Chapter 2 we present new observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter
Array (ALMA) of the 122- and 205-µm fine-structure line emission of singly-ionised nitrogen
in 9io9. The 122-/205-µm [N II] line ratio is sensitive to electron density, ne , in the ionised
interstellar medium, and we use this to measure ne ≈ 300 cm−3 averaged across the galaxy. This
is over an order of magnitude higher than the Milky Way average, but comparable to localised
Galactic star-forming regions. Combined with observations of the atomic carbon (C I(1–0)) and
carbon monoxide (CO J = 4–3) in the same system, we reveal the conditions in this intensely
star-forming system. The majority of the molecular interstellar medium has been driven to
high density, and the resultant conflagration of star formation produces a correspondingly dense
ionised phase, presumably co-located with myriad H II regions that litter the gas-rich disk.
In Chapter 3 we present the detection of the ground state rotational emission of ammonia, orthoNH3 (JK = 10 → 00 ) in 9io9. The integrated line profile is consistent with other molecular
and atomic emission lines which have resolved kinematics well-modelled by a 5 kpc-diameter
rotating disc. This implies that the gas responsible for NH3 emission is broadly tracing the
global molecular reservoir, but likely distributed in pockets of high density (n ≳ 5 × 104 cm−3 ).
With a luminosity of 2.8 × 106 L⊙ , the NH3 emission represents 2.5 × 10−7 of the total infrared
luminosity of the galaxy, comparable to the ratio observed in the Kleinmann-Low nebula in
Orion and consistent with sites of massive star formation in the Milky Way. If LNH3 /LIR serves
as a proxy for the ‘mode’ of star formation, this hints that the nature of star formation in extreme
starbursts in the early Universe is similar to that of Galactic star-forming regions, with a large
fraction of the cold interstellar medium in this state, plausibly driven by a storm of violent
disc instabilities in the gas-dominated disc. This supports the ‘full of Orions’ picture of star
formation in the most extreme galaxies seen close to the peak epoch of stellar mass assembly.
In Chapter 4 we present new ALMA observations of 9io9 detecting CO J=5→4 and its isotopologues 13 CO J=5→4 and C18 O J=5→4. Since 13 C is mainly produced by intermediatemass stars and 18 O is produced by massive stars, 13 CO/C18 O is sensitive to the shape of the
stellar initial mass function (IMF), where the IMF of the Milky Way has a power law slope
α2 ≈ 2.3–2.6 for stars of masses above 0.5 M⊙ . We measure a galaxy-integrated luminosity
ratio 13 CO/C18 O = 1.6 ± 0.1, consistent with the ratio observed in local ultraluminous infrared
galaxies and submillimetre-selected galaxies at high redshift, and significantly lower than the
13 CO/C18 O of the Milky Way. It has been argued that the low 13 CO/C18 O observed in extreme

star-forming galaxies in the early Universe is evidence for a top-heavy IMF in these systems.
In this work we use state-of-the-art chemical evolution models to conclude that irrespective of

stellar rotation, the observed 13 CO/C18 O is consistent with a Kroupa IMF with high-mass slope
of α2 = 2.3 (as in our Milky Way models) and also the steeper ‘top-heavy’ α2 = 2.1 slope.
In Chapter 5 we present a discussion of ongoing work on an ALMA spectral scan of 9io9,
alongside some potential future avenues of research, in particular pushing to higher resolution
with ALMA, and MIRI observations with JWST probing the mid infrared PAH emission as a
AGN diagnostic.

Acknowledgements
Over the past four and a half years I have been lucky to be surrounded by a great group of people
at and away from Hertfordshire and it’s only fitting that I thank them here.
Firstly, I am grateful to my supervisor Jim Geach, for offering me the position in the first place.
After not receiving any offers in my first round of applications, you can’t imagine how great it
felt to receive the offer to work with you these past few years. I appreciate the help and guidance
you’ve given me and your patience with my often slow and likely painful to read writing. Whilst
COVID scuppered some of the plans, I also appreciate the opportunity you gave me to be able
to travel to various places and conferences to present my work.
I also want to thank all of my collaborators for their helpful feedback on all of my paper drafts,
whilst sometimes there was slow progress, your inputs vastly improved the quality of the work
and for that I am grateful. I would in particular like to thank Rob Ivison and Chiaki Kobayashi,
who agreed to write me references as I look towards the next stage of my career.
I have been fortunate to meet and make good friends in the department and met a lot of great
PhD students too numerous to mention, with who discussing all the interesting things they were
working on have been a great and needed distraction from my own projects. Sharing the past few
years with everyone has been one of the highlights of my life thus far and I will miss everyone.
I would like to thank my Sub-mm brethren Tracy, who started her PhD journey alongside me
and was a great help to me in understanding the subject of which I was unfamiliar with before I
came, and helped keep things running when the rest of our year were too lazy to help.
I cannot leave out Kasia who after I had moved away in the last few months of writing this thesis
allowed me to stay on her sofa when I’ve returned to hatfield, it has really been appreciated by
me and my bank balance!
I would like to in particular thank the 2E50 peeps, sharing an office is only as good as the people
within and I have been lucky to share with a great group of people. To Alex, Max, and Tom
(Spriggs): Thank you for making me feel so welcome when I arrived and for helping me with
all my naı̈ve linux and python questions, without which I would probably still be staring at the
terminal blankly.
To Marina and Niall: You came into the office two years after me, but fit straight in our random
meandering discussions on lots of topics (including the ones Calum banned) as well as all the
science discussions (as everyone elses research was always more interesting than what I need
to do!) you both always made me enjoy coming in to the office. To Calum, the most consistent
member of the 2E50 peeps, we started on the same day and are finishing together as well. Whilst
we did our masters together (sorry for not remembering you), you have been a great friend and
v

office mate over the years. I will always remember you storming in the office whilst I was giving
an online talk during covid, and I’m sure that made an impression on everyone listening online
too!
To the 13 Horsa Gardens (astro house) crew, I lived there throughout my PhD and lived with
many different people from the department. To Athulya, Ben, Brian, Jaime, Maddie B, Maddie
S, Mike, Mubela, and Ryan. Whilst I wasn’t always the best housemate, I’ve had great times in
that house with you all over the years, thanks for all the help and support you have given me I
really appreciate it and I will miss living there as you have all made it feel like home.
I would also like to thank all of my friends from undergraduate and otherwise, who have put
up with me the last few years. Whilst we don’t see each other as much as I would like, your
friendship has helped me through hard times and I don’t think I would be writing this right now
without all of your support.
Finally I would like to thank my family. My mum Jewlee and step-dad Martyn, for nagging me
to keep working, being there for me, and helping me out whenever I needed it (including letting
me move back towards the end of writing my thesis. My dad, Micheal, who sadly isn’t here to
see me finish. You always took pride in what I was doing and I would enjoy our conversations
on it, even though you would try your best constantly embarrass me. To my brothers Chris,
Gareth, Jack, and Liam, for all the laughs we have when we all get together (and your taxes
which funded much of my education), the support (and free takeaways won’t be forgotten).

Introduction to the standard model of cosmology

The study of the Universe is one of our species’ oldest, with many cultures having their own
creation stories and myths. With the advent of the General theory of Relativity (Einstein, 1916)
and a host of observations in the 1920s (Slipher, 1917; Hubble, 1929) vastly increasing the scale
of our Universe, beyond just the Milky Way and revealing the expanding nature of our Universe,
cosmology started to become a scientific discipline in of itself.
The initial discovery of galaxies external to our own (or the island universe hypothesis at the
time), was made possible by the discovery of a so called ‘standard candle’. Henrietta Swan
Leavitt, in 1908 published results on a class of stars known as cepheid variables in the Magellanic clouds (Leavitt, 1908). What was found was a strong period-luminosity relation for this
class of stars, as such if you can measure the period, you can determine the luminosity and from
this a distance can be inferred. This seminal result made possible accurate distance determinations to what we now know to be different galaxies, so long as you can observe cepheids within.
The second key piece to our cosmological picture comes from redshift. Starting in the 1910s
with pioneering work by Slipher (Slipher, 1917), who by spectrally observing bright spiral ‘nebulae’ found them to have a far greater redshift than any star observed in the galaxy, implying
that these objects are moving away from us at far greater speeds, and unlikely to be part of the
Milky Way. Hubble in the 1920s (Hubble, 1929), combined both of these results and by looking
at the outer regions of many of these sources to find cepheid variables, determined distances to

Chapter 1. Introduction

many of these sources and found that these ‘nebulae’ lay well outside that of the known Milky
Way and their distance was proportional to their observed redshift.

1.1.1

Friedmann, Robertson, Lemaı̂tre, Walker and the standard model of cosmology

In the decade following the publication of GR, the race began and a multitude of solutions
to the equations, both exact, such as the Schwarzschild solution (Schwarzschild, 1916) and
approximate, with various solutions involving gravitational lensing (Einstein, 1936), another
of these solutions is known as the Friedmann, Robertson, Lemaı̂tre, Walker (FLRW) metric
(Friedmann, 1922). The FLRW metric is a cosmological solution to the Einstein equations,
under the assumption of an isotropic and homogeneous Universe, providing a simple model for
the history of the Universe with a few free parameters as shown in equation 1.1 in spherical
coordinates.

where c is the speed of light in vacuum, a is the scale factor, and k is a term defining spatial
curvature.
Over the decades a range of different cosmological models have been proposed to explain cosmological observations such as the redshifting of light from distant sources, the relative abundance of the light elements, etc, but models based on the FLRW metric have become the preferred models. The current ‘standard’ model of cosmology is known as ΛCDM where Λ refers to
the dominant source of energy density, nominally referred to as Dark Energy (which in this form
is also known as the cosmological constant), and CDM being cold dark matter, these denoting
the dominant sources of the Universe’s energy density.
By applying this metric to the Einstein equations, a set of two equations can be obtained describing the past, present, and future expansion and evolution of the Universe, known as the
Friedmann equations. For the standard model of cosmology these take the form:

constant, and k the spatial curvature taking the values of +1, 0, -1 corresponding to a positively
curved, flat, and negatively curved Universe.
A more convenient way of parameterising the equations 1.2 and 1.3 would be with respect to
the Hubble constant (H0 ) and the present density parameters Ω0,m , Ω0,r , Ω0,k and ΩΛ , which
correspond to the fraction of the Universe’s present energy density ‘locked’ up in the matter,
radiation, curvature, and dark energy.
Written in this form, the Friedmann equations are:

In equation 1.5, it can be seen that Ω0,k does not appear, this means that Ω0,k does not affect
the acceleration of the Universe (this is true for any source of energy density which falls off
by a−2 ). From these two equations, given the density parameters for the different components,
and the current expansion rate of the Universe, the past and future evolution of the Universe can
be described. Over the decades a range of predictions associated with the standard model have
been verified, most notably that of the discovery of the cosmic microwave background radiation
(CMB) in 1965 (Penzias and Wilson, 1965; Dicke et al., 1965). Observations of the CMB have
since become the gold standard in terms of constraining the free parameters in the Friedmann
equations, with a series of satellites of ever increasing sensitivity and resolution being launched
over the past few decades (Mather et al., 1990; Spergel et al., 2003; Planck Collaboration et al.,
2016). Observations of the CMB by the Planck satellite find the current contributions to the
energy density are: Ω0,Λ = 0.691, Ω0,c = 0.26, Ω0,b = 0.049 (Ω0,b and Ω0,c denote the baryonic
and dark matter contributions often included together in a matter term Ω0,m = Ω0,c + Ω0,b =
0.31) Planck Collaboration et al. (2016), and with a small contribution from radiation Ω0,r ≈
10−5 . Ω0,k , which is also present in equation 1.4, has been found to be consistent with zero, and
as such is usually ignored and omitted from equation 1.4.

During the 1980s as a response to certain fine-tuning problems within the Big Bang a brief period
of exponential expansion in the very early Universe known as inflation was proposed (Guth,
1981; Linde, 1983). Inflation precedes the classical picture and provides a natural solution to
a variety of problems found within, such as the flatness and horizon problems. The flatness
problem arises from the apparent unlikeliness of the Universe having this geometry. Unlike
the negatively and positively curved geometries, a flat Universe required a very specific energy
density, referred to as the critical density. Whilst the Universe could contain a slight curvature
below our current detection limits, the magnitude of curvature increases over time such that with
our current constraints, the Universe must have been flat to greater than 1 part in 1057 , which is
where the picture sat at inflation’s inception (Guth, 1981). Inflation explains the flatness of the
universe with its exponential expansion, this works as our observable Universe is just a small
patch of the totality, and whilst the entirety of it would likely have some curvature, it appears flat
on small enough scales. This explanation is analogous to the Earth, in which the whole Earth is
curved but on small everyday scales it appears to be flat.
The horizon problem, comes from observations of the CMB and that it is an almost perfect
blackbody with only very small perturbations found. This implies that these regions were at
some point in the past in thermal contact with each other, such that they could reach thermal
equilibrium. The problem with this is that information, such as this cannot be transmitted faster
than the speed of light. Given this constraint regions of the CMB at large distances from each
other could have never been in contact with each other, leaving the fact of their almost identical
temperatures unexplained. Inflation offers a natural explanation of this, before the inflationary
epoch our observable Universe was just a small patch, such that it was in thermal equilibrium.
Inflation’s exponential expansion then causes this patch to rapidly grow in size and in doing so
keeps the initial thermal equilibrium state.
Inflation also provides an explanation of the observed fluctuations within the CMB, which in
turn are thought to be the seeds in which clusters and galaxies will form. Whilst inflation has
become a key part of the standard picture, its experimental basis is still debated and a range of
theoretical questions remain, e.g. What causes inflation to begin and ultimately end?, What is
the inflationary potential?.
Following the inflationary picture, ΛCDM takes over and the FLRW metric defines the future
evolution of the Universe. The very early Universe is the realm of high energy physics, with the
Universe as a whole consisting of a plasma of subatomic particles. As the Universe continued to

Chapter 1. Introduction

expand and cool, these particle species began to ‘freeze-out’ as the energy density drops below
that needed to keep the rate of particle pair production, with that of their destruction rate. At
approximately 1-3 minutes after the Big Bang, Nucleosynthesis (BBN) takes place, where the
densities were such that the primordial plasma began fusing protons and neutrons together to
produce heavier elements. BBN produces negligible amounts of elements above Lithium due to
the short timescales, and the lack of stable elements with nucleon masses of 5 and 8. As such as
a result of BBN, the primordial mass fractions of the elements are dominated by Hydrogen and
Helium with ≈ 75% Hydrogen and ≈ 25% Helium abundances with trace amounts of any larger
elements with the next three most abundant being Deuterium, Helium-3 and Lithium-7 having
abundances of the order of 10−5 , 10−5 , and10−10 respectively.

1.1.2

The Cosmic Microwave Background Radiation

Between ∼ 3 minutes to ∼ 400, 000 years, the Universe existed as a plasma, with the energy
density on exceeding that required to ionise hydrogen. In this state, the Universe is opaque
as the photons are constantly scattered and absorbed (and then re-emitted) by the plasma. As
the Universe cooled, recombination occurred, and the Universe became neutral, with photons
then decoupling from the now neutral gas and able travel relatively unimpeded throughout the
Universe. This event is known as the last scattering surface. The last scattering surface occurred ≈ 380, 000 years after the Big Bang, when the Universe had a temperature of T ≈ 3000K
and since this epoch has cooled with the Universe’s expansion giving us what we see today,
with the radiation field peaking in the microwave wavelengths known as the cosmic microwave
background.
The CMB is an almost perfect blackbody initially at the temperature at last scattering, but today
due to cosmic expansion lies at a value of T ≈ 2.73K. As can be seen in Figure 1.1, this value is
remarkably consistent across the sky with tiny fluctuations in this value of the order of 1 part in
10,000, these small temperature fluctuations are thought to correspond to density fluctuations in
the early Universe (higher temperature corresponding to denser regions), and as such are thought
to be the seeds of galaxies and clusters of galaxies.

Galaxies

Prior to the 20th century, the Milky Way was the only known galaxy. Whilst many galaxies
had been previously observed, with a few being observed since ancient times (e.g. M31) their
fundamental nature was not understood until relatively recently.

1.2.1

Dark Matter Halos, and the formation of Galaxies

As section 1.1.2 stated, small variations in the density of material in the early universe are
thought to be the seeds of the galaxies and clusters of galaxies we see in our Universe. These
initial seeds, start small but over time due to gravity these seeds grew forming large dark matter
halos and the galaxies which lie within.

1.2.1.1

Dark Matter Halos

With the majority of the Universes matter being in the form of dark matter and providing the
dominant source of gravity, its evolution and subsequent distribution is indispensable in our

Chapter 1. Introduction

understanding of how the baryonic matter will coalesce into the galaxies we see all around us.
From N-body simulations it has been shown that over time non-linear growth of these initial
seeds grow and result in an approximately stable configuration supported against its own gravity by the random motion of the particles. The distribution of dark matter is not random, but
displays a clear structure. Whilst many different profiles have been proposed to model this distribution, the most commonly applied profile is what is known as the Navarro–Frenk–White
(NFW) profile, shown in Equation 1.6.

Where ρ is the dark matter density, r is the radius from the centre of the Halo, Rs is the scale
radius, ρ0 is a characteristic density for the Halo, with both Rs and ρ0 varying between different
halos.
It is within these halos, where the baryonic matter also collects producing the stars and galaxies
we observe and will be the focus of the rest of this subchapter.

1.2.1.2

Angular Momentum Exchange, Formation of Galactic Disks

In the local universe the dominant morphology of galaxies are that of disks (), that leads to
the question of how they obtained their angular momentum. The classical picture presented in
(Peebles, 1969), in which both the dark matter halos and the gas within, obtain their angular
momentum from tidal torques from interactions with their neighbours.
In this picture, the amount of angular momentum acquired by a halo is strongly dependant on
the Halo mass and the epoch in which it formed with J ∝ M 5/3 and J ∝ t respectively where t
is the lookback time (Catelan and Theuns, 1996). Unlike the dark matter halos, the gas within
can cool, in the next section I will briefly describe a couple mechanisms by which this can
occur, but the cooling allows the total energy to decrease however the angular momentum will
be approximately conserved. As the gas collapses, this causes them to continue to collapse in
the direction perpendicular to the rotation plane, and be supported against collapse in the plane
by this acquired angular momentum, leading to the formation of rotationally supported disks
(Mo et al., 1998).

Chapter 1. Introduction
1.2.1.3

Gas cooling

To allow the gas within the primordial galaxies to collapse and form stars, the gas first needs
to cool. Star formation occurs in cold molecular gas (∼ 100K), so mechanisms to cool the hot
primordial gas are required.
Compton Cooling
At high redshift (z > 6) Compton cooling is the main cooling mechanism of the the gas within
galaxies. At these high redshifts the density of CMB photons is such that interactions between
the photons and the electrons within the hot plasma in the dark matter halos can significantly
cool the gas. Peebles (1968) first derived the equation for this cooling timescale finding
τCompton =

2me c(1 + 1/xe )
,
4 (1 − T
8σT aTcmb
cmb /Te )

(1.7)

Where xe = ne /ntot with ne being the electron number density and nt the number density of
all the atoms and ions, a is the scale factor, Tcmb and Te are the CMB and electron temperature
respectively, and σT is the interaction cross section. As Compton cooling, unlike other cooling
mechanisms requires the interaction of a single particle with a cmb photon, the cooling rate only
scales linearly with the gas density (and the Compton timescale is independent of it), this is due
to the CMB having a constant density throughout the universe. As such Compton cooling can
occur in the dense centre of galaxies as well as the less dense outskirts, this is thought to be a
significant cooling mechanism at z > 6 (Benson, 2010).
Molecular Cooling
Another form of cooling comes from molecular species. Before stars are able to ‘pollute’ the Interstellar medium (ISM) with heavier elements, this comes in the form of cooling via molecular
hydrogen.
A simple explanation behind how this cooling works, is that collisions between molecules (primarily H2 with itself or another molecule such as CO) will excite electrons within the molecules,
and when the electron deexcite, a photon is emitted taking energy from the gas and thus cooling
it. Molecular gas cooling unlike compton cooling, requires the collision of molecules and as
such, unlike the case of compton cooling has a stronger dependence on density.

Star Formation

Arguably the most striking feature observed within galaxies are their stellar populations, with
the first stars in the universe thought to have been formed ≈ 200 million years after the big bang.
Whilst many questions surrounding the specifics of star formation are still up for debate, I will
briefly outline a general picture of the process here.
Molecular gas is the fuel from which galaxies form their stars, and is found in structures known
as giant molecular clouds (GMCs), these GMCs can remain in a state of hydrostatic equilibrium, so long as the gravitational attraction is balanced by the gas pressure of the cloud. If the
gravitational attraction exceeds that of the gas pressure, either from an external trigger (such as
a nearby supernova compressing the gas) or by accreting enough material, the gas cloud will
begin to collapse. For a gas cloud, the mass in which it will collapse will be that of its Jeans
mass

where T is the temperature of the gas cloud, and n is its density.
As the molecular cloud collapses it fragments into smaller and smaller pieces, until these fragments reach stellar masses. Up to this point much of the energy accrued by the gas, from the
gravitational potential energy is radiated away, and as such the gas temperature does not significantly increase. When the fragments become small enough, the gas becomes opaque to the
thermal radiation, trapping the energy, and causing the temperature of the fragments to increase
until a new equilibrium is reached halting the collapse (as can be seen in equation 1.8, increasing
the temperature increases the mass needed for gravitational collapse). At this stage a protostar is
formed. After the formation of a protostar, it continues to accrete material further growing and
heating as it accrues more gravitational potential energy, when the core reaches temperatures of
≈ 2000K, fusion can occur.
Star formation

1.2.1.5

Feedback

For decades it has been clear that Feedback is necessary and important component in the buildup
of galaxies, two key reasons for this are

Chapter 1. Introduction

10

• The total mass density of baryonic Matter is Ω0,b = 0.049, whereas the total stellar mass
density is Ω∗ = 0.0023 (Cole et al., 2001)
• The galaxy luminosity function differs from the dark matter halo mass distribution, with
there being fewer low and high mass galaxies, than would be expected if dark matter halos
turned a constant fraction of baryonic matter into stars. (Benson et al., 2003).

Stellar feedback
To explain the underproduction of low mass galaxies stellar feedback primarily in the form of
supernovae, imparting their energy into the ISM. The energy imparted into the ISM in these low
mass systems causes some of the gas to be ejected. With less gas now available to form stars,
this leads to lower star formation rates than expected and as such lowers the expected number
of low mass galaxies.
AGN feedback
For more massive galaxies, stellar feedback is not thought to be efficient enough to regulate the
star formation enough to explain the discrepancy between the expected and observed luminosity
functions. In this case AGN feedback is thought to be the main mechanism in reducing the
number of the brightest galaxies. Whilst the specific mechanisms via which this feedback works
is poorly understood, simple energetic arguments can be used to show the potential of AGN
feedback in having profound effects on its host galaxy. If the energy imparted into the galaxy
by the black hole (EBH ) is comparable to the binding energy of the galaxy Egal , than it’s clear
that it could have a significant effect on the future evolution of the galaxy. If a galaxy has
a velocity dispersion σ , than the binding energy is approximately Egal ≈ Mgal σ 2 . The mass
of the central black hole has been found to be intricately linked to the mass of the galaxy,
where MBH ≈ 10−3 Mgal (Merritt and Ferrarese, 2001; Kormendy and Gebhardt, 2001; Reines
and Volonteri, 2015). Assuming a radiative efficiency of accretion of approximately 10, than the
the energy released by the growth of the black hole is EBH = 0.1MBH c2 , or EBH = 10−4 Mgal c2 .
From this we can estimate the fraction of the galaxies binding energy is released by the black
2
hole, EEBH

meaning the energy output of the black hole greatly exceeds that of the galaxies binding energy.
If only a fraction of this energy is imparted into the gas within the galaxy, than the black hole
can have a profound effect on its evolution.
More sophisticated AGN feedback proscriptions than the simple argument presented above have
become an integral part of the most detailed galaxy formation models (Kauffmann and Haehnelt,

Chapter 1. Introduction

11

2000; Di Matteo et al., 2005; Schaye et al., 2015; Davé et al., 2019). Within these models it has
been found that AGN feedback can efficiently suppress the number of galaxies at the bright end
of the luminosity function and bring it into agreement with the observed distribution.

1.2.2

Hubble Tuning fork

An early attempt at classifying galaxies is the Hubble tuning fork, which separates galaxies
based on morphological features in the optical, with elliptical galaxies on one side and spirals,
which are split into two classes, corresponding to barred and unbarred spirals (Hubble, 1927).
In Hubble’s original classification, Elliptical galaxies were classified from E0-E7 measured by
their ellipticity, with a spherical galaxy categorised as E0 with E1-7 indicating ever increasing
ellipticity. Spirals on the other hand were separated into three separate categories based on the
following criterion:

• The relative size of the unresolved nuclear region
• The extent to which the arms are unwound (The openness/angle of the spiral)
• The degree of condensation in the arms

Hubble noted that these three criteria are independent, however there was a clear correlation
between the three with a few galaxies having conflicting categorisation. With these criteria,
galaxies classified as spirals were given labels Sa, Sb, Sc depending on how tightly wound the
spiral arms were, with the barred spirals given the same classifications but labeled SBa, SBb,
and SBc, where the capital B indicates the presence of a bar. Bars are as the name suggests bar
shaped structures, which are found at the centres of galaxies and composed of stars. Bars are
important feature of galaxies with approximately two-thirds of spiral galaxies containing one
and one-third possessing a strong one and are a efficient means of funneling gas from the outer
regions of the galaxy into the centre (Bournaud and Combes, 2002). Bars vary in their strength
and size, and are thought to be formed as a result of major and minor mergers (Hopkins et al.,
2009, 2010; Naab et al., 2014).
Whilst most galaxies Hubble looked at were found to fit nicely into the classification scheme,
some galaxies were found to be irregular in structure and were classified as such. Lenticular galaxies were unknown to Hubble at the time and were given the classification S0 placing

them at the intersection between Elliptical galaxies and the Spirals. The initial interpretation of
the Hubble tuning fork was that it represented an evolutionary progression, from the Elliptical
galaxies forming first and evolving into Spiral-like galaxies. This idea has since been rejected,
but this and more complicated classification schemes are still an indispensable tool used in understanding galaxy formation and evolution.

1.2.3

Luminous infrared Galaxies

Luminous infrared galaxies (LIRGs) are a class of bright infrared galaxies found in the local
Universe. Unlike the Hubble tuning fork classification above, LIRGs are classified not by morphology, but from their infrared luminosities. Infrared luminosities (LIR ) are defined over the
range 8 − 1000µm1 .
1 Definitions of the IR luminosity, can vary with 3 − 1100µm, being another common definition (Kennicutt and
Evans, 2012).

Chapter 1. Introduction

13

LIRG :1011 L⊙ ≤ LIR < 1012 L⊙
ULIRG :1012 L⊙ ≤ LIR < 1013 L⊙
HyLIRG :1013 L⊙ ≤ LIR < 1014 L⊙

The infrared emission is dominated by the reprocessing of stellar light via dust, with vast quantities of dust being linked to locations of recent star formation, these large luminosities in the
infrared and the close relationship between production and sites of recent star formation imply
large star formation rates. Using the standard LIR − SFR relation in Kennicutt and Evans (2012)
assuming the IR luminosity comes exclusively from sites of star formation, this corresponds to

LIRG :15M⊙ yr−1 ≤ LIR < 150M⊙ yr−1
ULIRG :150M⊙ yr−1 ≤ LIR < 1500M⊙ yr−1
HyLIRG :1500M⊙ yr−1 ≤ LIR < 15000M⊙ yr−1

A natural question to ask is what is triggering the high star formation rates in (U)LIRGs? Are
these elevated star formation rates found in merging systems, are secular processes responsible?,
or perhaps other environmental conditions such as the galaxies’ location within a cluster could
provide an explanation.
Studies of (U)LIRGs have found that in the local Universe, ULIRGs are almost exclusively
mergers, and this fraction decreases with decreasing IR luminosities (Sanders et al., 1988;
Veilleux et al., 2002). Larson et al. (2016) for example with a sample of 65 local (U)LIRGs
found that above LIR > 1011.5 all of their sample were mergers, but below this single galaxies
rapidly start to dominate with ≈40% at 1011.3 L⊙ and > 80% at 1011.1 L⊙ . The fact that the highest star forming galaxies in the local Universe are a result of mergers is not surprising as mergers
or close flybys work to compress and shock the gas within the interstellar medium (ISM) leading
to many new sites of star formation (Kim et al., 2009; Saitoh et al., 2009).

Chapter 1. Introduction

1.2.4

14

Interstellar Medium

Whist the stellar component of galaxies typically dominates much of the emitted light (note as
previously mentioned in IR bright sources this is not the case), ISM constitutes a large part of
the internal galaxy structure, containing the fuel for future star formation and holding the key to
understanding much about their past evolution. The ISM is an overarching term to describe all
of the contents of the space within galaxies between its stars. The ISM is primarily made up of
Hydrogen and Helium, polluted by metals produced by previous generations of stars. The ISM
can be separated into different components based on the density and temperature of the gas.

1.2.4.1

Ionised ISM

The ionised ISM refers to the regions in which hydrogen has been ionised (En = 13.6eV).
This component can be further subdivided into two separate sub-components: the warm ionised
medium (WIM), which describes the diffuse component typically consisting of densities of the
order of 0.1cm−3 and the denser HII regions which lie within molecular clouds at sites of recent
star formation, ionised by the massive stars found within.

1.2.4.2

Molecular ISM

The molecular component of the ISM is of unique importance due to it being central in the
star formation process. Stars form out of the cool (< 100K) molecular gas within galaxies
(Elmegreen, 2012), and as such there is a strong relationship between a galaxy’s molecular gas
abundance and its resulting star formation rate. Starting with Schmidt (1959), it was found that
there was a close relation between a galaxies star formation rate surface density and that of its
gas surface density, more recent analyses such as that in de los Reyes and Kennicutt (2019) have
found that the relationship known as the Kennicutt-Schmidt law and is parameterised by the
following power law:
ΣSFR = AΣNgas

(1.9)

where ΣSFR and Σgas correspond to the SFR and gas surface densities, with A and N being the
normalisation and slope of the relation. Kennicutt (1998) found that this relation holds over
a large range of gas densities and SFRs with an exponent N ≈ 1.4. The consistency of this
relation has meant that this and slight modifications of this relation (such as the inclusion of the

Chapter 1. Introduction

15

dynamical time) are used throughout the literature and are used to determine the star formation
within most cosmological simulations. With star formation being an important part of galaxy
formation and evolution, this relation is an important ingredient in such simulations (see e.g.
Schaye et al., 2015; Davé et al., 2019).
Whilst the exponent of the relation for molecular gas more generally is found to be N≈ 1.5
a more direct relation between the molecular gas and star formation within a galaxy can be
found, with dense molecular gas. Dense molecular gas is usually defined as that of gas at
densities exceeding 104 cm−3 , and is thought to be the gas densities in which star formation will
be actively occurring. Gao and Solomon (2004) using the sub-mm ground state HCN emission,
which traces gas at densities n(H2 ) > 3 × 103 cm−3 found a strong linear relation between the IR
luminosity (and hence SFR) and the HCN(1-0) line luminosity. This pioneering work has since
been extended further into sub-galactic scales (see e.g. Krips et al., 2008; Jiménez-Donaire et al.,
2019) and into the ULIRG regime (see e.g. Privon et al., 2015; Bigiel et al., 2016), now spanning
over many orders of magnitude in IR luminosity.
Much of these detections have been limited to low-z sources, more recent work presented in Rybak et al. (2022) attempted to detect the ground state emission in a small sample of lensed SMGs.
Whilst no clear detections of the ground state were found, one source had a tentative detection,
and the HCN/LIR ratio from the limits were consistent with that of local z ∼ 0 ULIRGs, but
lower than expected for the aforementioned linear relation. This could be hinting at a deviation
from the linear relation at high SFRs, which has been predicted by various models (Krumholz
and Thompson, 2007; Narayanan et al., 2008).

1.2.4.3

Dust

The final important ingredient in our discussion of the ISM is dust. Historically the understanding of dust and its behaviour was driven by the need to obtain accurate colours and fluxes of
objects due to its obscuring nature (Li and Greenberg, 2003). In recent years dust has become
more important as a diagnostic tool, with observatories built with the purpose of observing the
thermal emission from it. Understanding of dust is especially important in the case of IR bright
galaxies, which are known to contain a large quantity of dust attenuating the stellar light, and
constitutes the majority of the emission from these sources.

Chapter 1. Introduction

16

Whilst the primary production route of dust grains is still up for debate, it is clear that it is produced in a range of sources/environments such as the atmospheres of Asymptotic Giant Branch
(AGB) stars (e.g. Ferrarotti and Gail, 2006; Di Criscienzo et al., 2013), cold dense regions of the
ISM and ejecta from core collapse supernovae (Todini and Ferrara, 2001; Sarangi and Cherchneff, 2013). Once created, dust evolves by physical processes, which can both help them grow,
such as accretion of gas phase metals in dense molecular clouds (Inoue et al., 2016; Köhler et al.,
2015) and also facilitate their destruction such as in supernovae shocks, thermal spluttering, and
collisions between dust grains (e.g. Draine and Salpeter, 1979; Jones and Nuth, 2011; Bocchio
et al., 2014).

1.2.5

The Initial Mass Function

The initial mass function (IMF) is arguably the most important parameter used to interpret our
astronomical observations. All derivations of star formation rates, stellar masses, etc. are all
dependent on this. The IMF as the name suggests is a measure of the distribution of the initial
masses of stars that form in a star-forming environment. As individual stars are practically
unobservable outside of the Milky Way and a handful of other galaxies (such as Andromeda and
the Magellanic clouds), all direct measurements of it come from these.
IMFs are typically parameterised with power laws, with different IMFs opting for a different
number of these to describe various mass ranges, as shown in Table 3.1. The number of stars
dN in the mass interval m to m + d(log(m)) is therefore given by the following equation.

dN ∝ mα−1 d(log(m))

(1.10)

Where α depends on the specific IMF. Starting in the 1950s with work by Edwin Salpeter, who
observed stars from G7 to B0 (or stars in the mass range ∼ 1 − 10M⊙ ), found that they could
be described by a single power law with a slope of α = 2.35 (Salpeter, 1955). Since this work
a range of different IMFs have been proposed, with a range of different values for the slope, as
well as offering a combination of slopes in different mass ranges (Kroupa et al., 1993; Kroupa,
2001; Chabrier, 2003). Fig 1.3 shows a range of different IMFs with Table 1.1 providing the
parameterisations for these.

TABLE 1.1: Parameterisations and relative SFRs of various IMFs in the literature

Parameterisations of Initial Mass Functions that are popularly used in the literature. * The
Chabrier IMF is typically parameterised as a log-normal distribution below M< 1M⊙ , with the
form ξ (m) = 0.158(1/(m ln(10))) exp[−(log(m) − log(0.08))2 /(2 × 0.692 )].

As can be seen in Figure 1.3, the high mass slope (M > 1M⊙ ), is typically parameterised similarly to the Salpeter IMF with a slope of α2 ≈ 2.3 with the majority of the variation coming
from the low mass end. However there appears to be two camps for the high mass end, with one
camp following the Salpeter slope and the other giving a steeper slope of α2 ≈ 2.7 first given in
Scalo (1986), and typically arises from the different methods used to constrain it (field vs YSO
counting).
In the extragalactic Universe, the most commonly adopted IMFs are the Salpeter, Kroupa 2 , and
Chabrier IMFs all which have a high mass slope of α ≈ 2.3. Despite their similar high mass
slopes these IMFs differ more substantially in their parameterisations of the low mass end. The
Chabrier IMF paramaterises the low mass end with a single log-normal distribution below 1M⊙ ,
and the Kroupa IMFs opt for extra power law components. For the majority of extragalactic
purposes, the Chabrier and Kroupa are in effect interchangable due to their similar mass-to-light
ratios, resulting in comparable SFRs as seen in Table 1.1.

F IGURE 1.3: Commonly adopted IMFs in the literature

Initial Mass Functions that are popularly used in the literature. Most agree well with the
canonical Salpeter slope (α2 ≈ 2.3), except Kroupa et al. (1993), which has a Scalo (1986) like
high mass slope and is typically used in some chemical evolution models (see e.g. Romano
et al., 2017, 2019), though the more standard Kroupa (2001) is also used (see e.g. Kobayashi
et al., 2011, 2020)
constrain the IMF, with mixed results. Rather than the direct young stellar object (YSO) counting, extragalactic attempts to constrain the IMF often work by comparing a few IMFs to certain
properties of galaxies, and see how well the predictions of the IMF match to the observations.
Work on giant elliptical galaxies have typically found evidence of a bottom-heavy IMF in the
inner regions by analysing mass to light ratios. This approach requires a luminosity independent
way of obtaining stellar mass, such as modelling the stellar kinematics or by observing the
deflection of light from a background source, coupling this with a mass to light ratio expected
for a standard IMF (typically Kroupa (2001) or Chabrier (2003)). If there is a discrepancy
between the two values can be explained either by an excess in stellar remnants (e.g. black
holes) or via an excess in brown dwarfs, i.e. a top-heavy/bottom-heavy IMF Smith (2020).
Sub-mm galaxies often thought to be the precursers of the local massive ellipticals, are another
class of galaxies in which a heavy-IMF has been inferred (usually a top-heavy IMF is argued)

(Baugh et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2018b; Romano et al., 2019). For SMGs different methods/arguments have been employed to probe the IMF, early arguments like that presented in Baugh
et al. (2005) come from the sub-mm number counts, which measure the 850µm number counts
of sub-mm emitting sources, and the apparent inability of a canonical IMF to reproduce the
numbers observed. Baugh et al. (2005) found that in their models, they could match both the
SMG number counts and the number counts of lyman break galaxies (LBGs), this was the first
model able to match both of these populations with previous failing on one or both of these
counts. They did this by invoking a top-heavy IMF within bursts of star formation. More recent work on the number counts have alleviated this problem significantly with Cai et al. (2020)
and Lovell et al. (2021) finding general agreement with the sub-mm number counts assuming a
canonical IMF.
A second approach to constraining the IMF in sub-mm galaxies, comes from observing chemical
isotopes of carbon and oxygen, due to their different formation routes where 13 C is thought to
be produced in intermediate mass stars (1 − 4M⊙ ) and 18 O is thought to be produced in massive
stars (> 8M⊙ ), the relative abundances of these two isotopes should be sensitive to the high
mass slope of the IMF (α2 ), this approach has more recently been studied in detail in Zhang
et al. (2018b), for a sample of SMGs via the rotational transitions of 13 CO and C18 O, and will
also be discussed in more detail in chapter 4

1.2.6

Sub-mm Galaxies

Sub-mm Galaxies (SMGs) are so named due to their brightness at sub-mm wavelengths and
their faintness in many of the optical bands, are a class of extreme star forming galaxies found in
the high-z (z > 1) Universe. With the advent of a powerful new generation of sub-mm detectors
such as SCUBA on the JCMT in the 1990s (see below), it finally became possible to detect these
extreme systems with a multitude of papers (Smail et al., 1997; Hughes et al., 1998) detailing
the discovery of this previously unknown population of galaxies. With star formation rates of
100 − 1000M⊙ yr−1 (Chapman et al., 2010) typically found (assuming a standard Initial Mass
Function see section 1.2.5 for a discussion), SMGs are seen as high-z analogues of the local
ULIRGs observed in the local Universe.

where τ is the frequency

Negative k-correction

A key advantage of observing at sub-mm wavelengths is the negative k-correction of SMGs.
The necessity of applying a k-correction arises from the fact that observing objects which lie at
different redshifts with the same frequency, are measuring different parts of the rest frame SED.
For an object at z ≈ 0 the relationship between apparent and absolute magnitude can be expressed
as the following:

m = M + 5log10


(1.13)

where DL is the luminosity distance, extending this to objects at z > 0, a k-correction component
is required due to the observed frequency and the emitted (or obs) frequency no longer being the
same (νobs ̸= νem ).

Example SED for a sub-mm bright galaxy from the SED fitting code Prospector, Prospector

wavelength transition currently included.
in this form, Krest,obs is the k-correction, and is dependant on the redshift of the source and the
shape of the SED between the two frequencies νobs and νobs .
For sub-mm galaxies in particular, where the SED is well modelled by a equation 1.12, the flux
will remain approximately constant throughout a wide range of redshifts. This is true as long
as we stay within the Rayleigh-Jeans tail of the SED, in this regime equation 1.12 becomes (as
the flux units are typically not given in magnitudes for sub-mm wavelengths here I will work in
units of flux density)

Observational and theoretical modelling of dust emission typically find a value of β ≈ 2 (typically between 1 and 3 )(Blain et al., 2002). With β ≈ 2 equation 1.17 tells us that the observed
flux Sνobs becomes constant.

flux density is approximately constant throughout a wide range of redshifts (z ≈ 1 − 10). The
negative k-correction for 850µm allows SMG to be studied across cosmic time without a strong
redshift dependent brightness limit.

1.3

Sub-mm Astronomy

1.3.1

The advent of sub-mm astronomy

Astronomy is an ancient science with humans observing the night sky for thousands of years.
For almost all of that time, we were limited to observations in just the optical. With the discovery
of infra-red light in the early 1800s (Walker, 2000) it became clear that the light we see consisted
of just a small fraction of the total electromagnetic (EM) spectrum.
In the 200 years or so since this discovery astronomy has been revolutionised by technological
advances in detectors of these previously unseen wavelengths, gamma (< 10−11 m), sub-mm
(0.3 − 1.0mm), etc. In the last few decades of the 20th century, a range of observatories designed for the sub-mm wavelengths came online, such as the James Clerk Maxwell Telescope
(JCMT) in 1987 in Hawaii and more recently arrays, such as the Atacama Large Millimetre/Submillimetre Array (ALMA) in Chile in 2011. Unlike optical wavelengths which detect the direct
emission from stars, gas and AGN, sub-mm wavelengths are dominated by the reprocessing of
stellar light by dust grains, by absorbing the incident light from the stellar populations and reemitting it as thermal radiation in the infrared. For illustrative purposes I will outline a brief
calculation of how this process works for a single dust grain ≈ 10pc from a A-type star.
At the heart of this calculation is that of energy conservation, with the dust grain absorbing the
incoming light from the star, heating, and then re-emitting this energy as thermal radiation. The
dust grain will continue to heat until it reaches thermal equilibrium.
Assuming that the spectral energy distribution (SED) from the star is a blackbody, we can use
the Stefan-Boltzmann law which states

I = σT4

(1.18)

Chapter 1. Introduction

24

Where I is the flux, σ is the Stefan-Boltzmann constant and T is the temperature of the emitting
object which in our case this will be the star (Tstar ) and the dust grain (Tdust ) once it has been
heated.
For a star of radius Rstar , the luminosity Lstar is given by
Lstar = 4πR2star σ T 4

(1.19)

and for a typical dust grain of size r located at distance D from the star, approximating the
absorbing area as a circular region of radius (r). We can approximate the flux absorbed Iab as

Iab =

Lstar r2
4D2

(1.20)

Which applying the Stefan-Boltzmann law for the star this becomes
Iab =

4 r2
πR2star σ Tstar
D2

(1.21)

As energy is conserved, the luminosity of the dust grain Ldust , once thermal equilibrium has
been reached must match the incident flux absorbed so Iab = Ldust . This means that Iab in
Equation 1.21 can be replaced by Ldust giving

Ldust =

4 r2
πR2star σ Tstar
D2

(1.22)

Assuming that the emission from the dust grain is also that of a blackbody (this is reasonable for
individual dust grains but in the case of a large number of dust grains each of which will absorb
emitted light from other dust grains, the ensemble is better described by a modified blackbody,
see Section 1.2.6.1), we can again apply the Stefan-Boltzmann law, this time to the dust grain.
This gives us

4πr2 σ Tdust

which as can be seen, simplifies to

(1.25)

putting in reasonable numbers for our stars parameters, Tstar = 8000K, Rstar = 1.8R⊙ (1.3 ×
109 m) which is the approximate temperature and radius for an A-type (A5V) star, and D = 10pc
(3.086 × 1017 m) we obtain the equilibrium temperature of the dust grain to be Tdust = 0.5K.
This is approximately a factor of 5 below the typically observed dust temperatures of 20 −
40K however dust grains will lay at varying distances from stars, which also vary greatly in
luminosity. As such this calculation should only be viewed as an illustration of the principles.
A significant limitation of observing with a single dish in the sub-mm wavelengths are resolution
constraints. For a diffraction limited telescope the equation that determines the resolving power
is:
∆θ =

1.22λ
D

(1.26)

where λ is the wavelength of the observed light and D is the diameter of the dish. To illustrate
the magnitude of the effect, for the JCMT with a 15m dish, the diffraction limited resolution for
observations at 450µm is ∼ 8′′ , compared to Hubble, which has a 2.4m mirror observing mostly
in the optical, the diffraction limit at 500nm is 0.05′′ . As the resolution increases linearly with
the dish, to obtain Hubble type resolutions would require a infeasibly large dish of ∼ 2km, thus
alternative methods to obtain comparable resolutions are required.

1.3.2

Interferometry

To overcome the resolution limits of single dish observatories, a technique called interferometry
can be used. Interferometers typically overcome this limitation by using many single dish antennae linked together to form an array, this produce an effective telescope with a size defined
by the largest separation between any two dishes in the array. Equation 1.27 therefore becomes
∆θ =

1.22λ
B

(1.27)

Chapter 1. Introduction

26

Where B is the largest separation between two dishes. Figure 1.6 shows a simple schematic for
a two dish inteferometer, but the principles can be applied to an arbitrary number of dishes.
Two-dish Interferometer Starting with the simple case of observing a source with a two dish
interferometer as shown in Figure 1.6. From Fig 1.6 we have a plane wave arriving at telescope
i and j, which are separated from each other by the vector B. The path delay between the two
waves are given by B.s with s being the unit vector in the direction of the source and the phase
shift being given by kB.s where k = 2π/λ .
If the electric field received at the first dish is E, than the second dish will receive an electric field
EeikB.s due to the phase delay. Multiplying these signals together electronically and then adding
together the fringe patterns across the source we arrive at the response R of the interferometer
Z

R=

I(σ )eikB.(s+σ )

(1.28)

Where I(σ ) is the intensity of the source and (s + σ ) is the vector in the direction of a particular
part of the source (which would have an intensity I(dσ ).
As eikB.s is a result of the array configuration and not dependent on the source we can remove
this from the integral giving

R = eikB.s

Z

I(σ )eikB.σ dσ

(1.29)

and further to this as can be seen in Figure 1.6 σ is parallel to the projected baseline vector b,
which allows us to use the following relation B.σ = b.σ , giving us a more useful form for the
response

R=e

Z

I(σ )eikb.σ dσ

(1.30)

This leaves us with a set of fringes (contained in the term eikB.s ) and the integral component
that is of interest ( I(σ )eikb.σ ). As B and s are known, a phase rotation is applied to remove
R

this component, which in radio interferometry usually involves adding electronic delays to the
signals.
By decomposing b and σ into their coordinates such that σ = σx i + σy j = xi + yj and B = ui + vj
giving

R(u, v) =

I(x, y)e2π ib.(ux+vy) dxdy

(1.31)

This is the familiar Fourier transform, where k becomes 2π as u and v are in wavelength units.
The choice of decomposition for b, may seem unusual, however it has a fairly simple interpretation, with one component being parallel to the equator at the nearest point to the source and the
second component, parallel to this point and the North Pole. By choosing this decomposition
we naturally arrive at the Fourier transform simplifying future calculations.
Filling the uv plane
The key to obtaining good interferometric data, is an understanding of the uv plane. The uv
plane is inversely proportional to physical scales on the sky, which means larger separations in
uv space correspond to information about smaller physical scales. As can be seen in Figure 1.7,
for short integration times, the uv plane consists of many points, these correspond to all the
various separations of each of the antenna with respect to every other. Many gaps exist in the

Chapter 1. Introduction

28

uv plane, which means information about a range of spatial scales will also be missing. Ideally
there will be no gaps in the uv plane over range of scales required for your observations. This
is the case for a single dish observation, however as discussed its completely infeasible to build
a single dish of the order of a few kilometres. Due to this other ways of filling the uv space are
required, this is achieved by increasing the number of antennae in the array, as well as taking
longer exposures of the source. With increased integration times, the Earth rotates throughout
an observation, this rotation changes the relative separations between the antennae which means
the uv separations also change leading to further population of the uv plane. Figure 1.8 gives
an example of this effect, by simulating an ALMA observation, similar to the one shown in
Figure 1.7, but this time for an integration time of approximately 5 hours. As can be seen, the
uv plane is considerably more sampled, leading to less ’missing’ information across the scales
sampled by the synthetic observations. Imaging directly (applying the reverse Fourier transform
to return to the xy sky plane) using the sampled uv plane, gives us what is known as the dirty
image.
The CLEAN algorithm
Even in ideal situations the uv plane will have gaps, and as we want to be able to image more
and more in shorter and shorter integration times, this requires algorithms to take our incomplete uv space and produce an accurate image, without artefacts from this incomplete sampling.
The CLEAN algorithm, first developed by Högbom (1974), revolutionised radio interferometry.
The algorithm and its descendants remain the primary methods used in imaging interferometric
data. CLEAN is a non-linear algorithm, which works iteratively starting with the dirty map (I0 ),
adding a delta function to the position with the largest residual flux (The largest flux value in the
region of the map without the source). The response of the antennae to this delta function is then
subtracted to produce a new image (I1 ), this procedure is then repeated until either the maximum
number of iterations is met or until the residuals fall below some preset threshold (e.g. the noise
level of the dirty image), giving a final image In . When either of these conditions are met it is
assumed that the residual values constitute the noise within the observations.
Visibility weighting
When creating an image, interferometric observations allow us to add weightings to the sampled
points within the uv plane. A simple case would be to weight all of the sampled uv plane equally
(W (u, v) = 1) and all the unsampled regions weighted as zero (W (u, v) = 0). In most situations,
however, various different weighting schemes are employed to the uv plane, the most popular of
which are:

Chapter 1. Introduction

29

Natural Weighting: This weighting scheme can be expressed as W (u, v) = σ12 (where σ is the
noise in the image) for regions with uv sampling and 0 outside this range. As there is typically
more noise from the longer baselines and hence smaller angular resolutions, this weighting
scheme prioritises the sensitivity of the observations whilst reducing the resultant resolution.
Uniform Weighting: This scheme weights the uv points inversely proportional to the ’local’
density of the uv points. As shorter baselines tend to be better sampled than longer baselines,
this leads to longer baselines being weighted up, thus reducing sensitivity but increasing the
resultant resolution.
Briggs Weighting: This weighting scheme provides a compromise between the two aforementioned weightings with

Where SN2 is the natural weight for the cell and Sthresh

1.3.2.1

Atacama large millimetre/sub-millimetre array

As this thesis makes use of one interferometer in particular, it is of relevance to provide a brief
outline of it here. ALMA is as its name suggests an interferometer that observes in the submillimetre and millimetre wavelengths and is located at an altitude of ≈ 5000m in the Atacama
desert in Chile. ALMA began operations in 2011 and as of now consists of 66 antennas, 54 of
which measure 12m in diameter and the remaining 12 measuring 7m. It offers spectral coverage
from approximately 30 − 950GHz (0.3 − 10mm). By using these antennas in different configurations with baselines up to 16km, ALMA can offer a range of resulting resolutions from
a few arcseconds in more compact configurations down to a few milliarcseconds in extended
configurations.

1.4

Gravitational Lensing

At high-z the sensitivity and resolution limits of observatories place more stringent limits on
what can be observed. Gravitational lensing offers a way to overcome these challenges by
magnifying the flux and spatial scales of distant galaxies.
The bending of light in a gravitational field was the first detected during the 1919 Solar eclipse
(Dyson et al., 1920), and provided the first direct confirmation of Einstein’s general theory of
relativity by observing the subtle shift in the position of stars caused by the Sun’s gravity. For
the Sun this deflection angle is small (α̂ ≈ 1.4′′ ), due to the ‘weak’ curvature in spacetime due to
the sun. However, in stronger gravitational fields like that surrounding black holes this effect is
exaggerated, or on larger scales that of galaxies and galaxy clusters due to the negligible proper
motions of these objects on the sky, the lensing effect is not transient like that of the sun on
timescales typically observable to us.

Simple Lens model

Whilst a full description of gravitational lens modelling is complicated and a thesis length description in of itself, it is beyond the scope of this thesis, and as such I will provide a simplified
description here.
As the distances DLS and DL are typically much greater than the size of the lensing object in
galaxy-galaxy lensing, to simplify things I will assume the thin lens approximation. The lens
works to change the incoming angle of the light compared to the case where there is no lens,
with the angle β between the source and the lens, into a new image with an angle denoted by
θ and the reduced lensing angle α = θ − β , assuming small angle deflections it can be seen in
Figure 1.9 that the actual deflection angle α̂ is given by:

in this figure so beginning with the various angles, β is the angle between the source and the

lens and the lensed image (hence θ = α + β ), and the final angle α̂ is the actual deflection
angle which is the angle the light has been deflected by the lens. The other variables are for
distances with DLS , DL , and DS being the distances between the Lens and the source, observer
to the lens, and the observer to the source respectively. ξ is the distance between the the light

These two solutions indicate that for a point source lens, the lensed source is imaged twice,
producing an Einstein ring inside of the Einstein angle (θ− ) and one on the outside (θ+ ). As
beta increases in equation 1.40 we can see the two images diverge, with one image approaching
the lens and the other approaches the true position of the source.
Now we have seen how the Einstein ring changes depending on the relative positions of the
source and lens, I will now turn attention to the expected magnification of the lens. Liouville’s
theorem, which tells us that the surface brightness of the source will be conserved under lensing,
shows us that the magnification can be simply calculated by the ratio of the image size to the
ImageArea

As we already have the equation for θ with respect to β , we can put in the results to obtain a

As an example, for 9io9, the source of interest to this thesis and discussed in section 1.5, we
can obtain a crude value for the magnification using the best fit parameters from the lensing

the Einstein radius, which is true in the Spherically symmetric case (Asada, 1997)) we obtain
a magnification factor µ ≈ 16, this is in reasonable agreement with the more sophisticated lens
modelling which results in µ = 14.7 ± 0.3 (Geach et al., 2018).

9io9: a strongly lensed SMG

9io94 is a intrinsically hyperluminous SMG lying at z = 2.55. First discovered via the citizen
science project SpaceWarps (Geach et al., 2015; Marshall et al., 2016; More et al., 2016). The
aim of SpaceWarps was to discover new lensing systems in thousands of iJKs composite images
covering the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Stripe 82 field. 9io9 was quickly flagged as a potential
lens, the cutout shown to the volunteers can be seen in Fig 1.10, with the red ring clearly visible.
4 Also referred to as the Red Radio Ring (RRR) in the literature

Chapter 1. Introduction

35

After its discovery a swathe of observations were taken of 9io9 most notably in the Radio and
Sub-mm wavelengths, finding from a modified black-body fit covering a range of sub-mm wavelengths (including the peak of the sub-mm SED with Herschel) that 9io9 is a Hyper-Luminous
Infrared Galaxy (HyLIRG, LIR > 1013 L⊙ ), inferring a star formation rate of ≈ 2000M⊙ yr−1
assuming a Chabrier IMF (Geach et al., 2015; Harrington et al., 2019). Alongside its intrinsic brightness, due to it lensed nature it has been magnified with a flux weighted magnification
µ = 14.7 ± 0.3 (Geach et al., 2018). This magnification means its Sub-mm SED peaks at ≈ 1Jy
making it one of the brightest high-z sub-mm sources and thus an attractive source for followup studies. Radio observations also taken at this time, found that 9io9 also emits prolifically
in the radio wavebands with a infrared to radio luminosity ratio exceeding that expected from
Star-formation alone, hinting at the presence of an AGN at its centre. Equation 1.45 is a simple diagnostic for the presence of AGN, with starforming galaxies being found to have a tight
relationship with ⟨q⟩ ≈ 2.5 with a 0.25 dex scatter (Ivison et al., 2010). 9io9 was found to have
q = 1.8 ± 0.1 placing it far above this relation and hence potentially hosting an AGN.
Alma follow-up observations presented in Geach et al. (2018) targeting the CO(4-3) and Ci(10) transitions tracing the dense star-forming molecular gas and total molecular gas reservoir
respectively, found that much of the molecular gas has been driven to high density, fuelling
the star formation within. Alongside these lines the blended CN(4-3) and HNC(5-4) transitions
were serendipitously detected, after deblending, Geach et al. (2018) found an excess in the
red end, potential evidence of interaction between the dense molecular disk and the growing
supermassive black hole at its centre producing an outflow.

due to its extreme sub-mm flux density 9io9 was also detected and flagged as a potential lensed
source in multiple other surveys independently of SpaceWarps, from a combination of the Planck
Catalog of compact sources(Harrington et al., 2016), the Herschel-Stripe 82 survey (Viero et al.,
2014), and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (Su et al., 2017).
Since its discovery, 9io9, also referred to as the Red Radio Ring (RRR) in the literature, has
become one of the most studied lensed sub-mm galaxies.

Volunteers were shown a sequence of 40 arcsec cut-out images where the blue channel

centred on luminous red galaxies (LRGs), groups and clusters, and quasars. In the case of 9io9,
a red ring of radius ≈ 3 arcsec can be seen around the central galaxy (an LRG at z = 0.2).This
lens was identified by numerous volunteers as a pontential lens and quickly became a high
confidence canditate lens.

This Thesis

Having outlined the current picture of cosmology and galaxy evolution, in particular that of
dusty infrared bright sources, we move our focus to the aims of this thesis. This thesis aims to
investigate the conditions within the ISM of sub-mm galaxies, in particular the aforementioned
lensed source 9io9. Our aims are as follows

• Better understand the ionised component of the ISM, are the conditions like that of the
Milky Way, a scaled up molecular cloud, or completely different?
• What is driving and sustaining the star formation in 9io9?
• What is the IMF like in these extreme starbursts, do we need to apply a non-canonical
IMF in these systems and how does this affect our derived properties.

In chapter 2 we provide observations of ionised gas in 9io9 via the sub-mm [NII ] forbidden
lines. This work probes the density of the ionised ISM, by utilising both the 122µm and 205µm
lines in combination to work as a densiometer of the ionised ISM, to determine whether like the
molecular ISM much of this important component of the ISM has been driven to high density.
In chapter 3 we present observations of the ground state rotational transition of Ammonia. This
relatively unexplored tracer probes some of the densest gas (> 106 cm−3 ) within the ISM, by
comparing the resultant NH3 / LIR ratio with that of local star forming regions we probe the
NH3 - LIR relation.
In chapter 4 we investigate the IMF within 9io9, using rotational transitions of the CO isotopologues (13 CO and C18 O). The isotopologue ratio has been found to vary by approximately an
order of magnitude between starburst galaxies (ULIRGs and SMGs) and that of local spirals,
with this ratio argued to be sensitive to the shape of the high mass slope of the IMF. By incorporating state of the art chemical evolution simulations, and varying the IMF and SFH of a
simulated galaxy using stellar yields both with and without the inclusion of stellar rotation we
further investigate the conditions under which a variation in the IMF could be warranted.
In Chapter 5 we present a discussion of future work which can build on the work presented here
and help further our understanding of the conditions and improving our understanding of 9io9,
as well as that of dusty star forming galaxies in general.

Abstract
We present new observations with the Atacama Large Millimeter/sub-millimeter Array of the
122- and 205-µm fine-structure line emission of singly-ionised nitrogen in a strongly lensed
starburst galaxy at z = 2.6. The 122-/205-µm [N II] line ratio is sensitive to electron density, ne ,
in the ionised interstellar medium, and we use this to measure ne ≈ 300 cm−3 averaged across
the galaxy. This is over an order of magnitude higher than the Milky Way average, but comparable to localised Galactic star-forming regions. Combined with observations of the atomic
carbon (C I(1–0)) and carbon monoxide (CO J = 4–3) in the same system, we reveal the conditions in this intensely star-forming system. The majority of the molecular interstellar medium
has been driven to high density, and the resultant conflagration of star formation produces a
correspondingly dense ionised phase, presumably co-located with myriad H II regions that litter
the gas-rich disk.

Introduction

With the discovery of a population of high-redshift submillimeter-selected galaxies (SMGs) over
two decades ago (Smail et al., 1997; Barger et al., 1998; Hughes et al., 1998), it became clear
that some galaxies undergo episodes of intense star formation in the early Universe, with rates
1000× that of the Milky Way. Thought to be the progenitors of the most massive galaxies in the
Universe today (Simpson et al., 2014; Toft et al., 2014), undergoing a period of rapid assembly, a
central question has been how such extreme levels of star formation are driven in these galaxies?
With the advent of sensitive, resolved submillimeter and millimeter imaging and spectroscopy
of the SMG population at high redshift (see Hodge and da Cunha, 2020, for a recent review), a
broad picture is emerging: molecular gas reservoirs are extended on scales of several kiloparsecs (Menéndez-Delmestre et al., 2009; Ivison et al., 2011; Riechers et al., 2011) with a large
fraction of the molecular interstellar medium (ISM) driven to high density, driving high instantaneous star-formation rates (SFRs) due to the increased fraction of the ISM participating in star
formation at any one time (Gao and Solomon, 2004; Oteo et al., 2017).
But what is the nature of star formation in these extreme systems? Is it essentially identical to
what we observe in discrete pockets in the disk of the Milky Way, but occurring more prevalently
throughout the ISM? Or is the phenomenon of star formation in these extreme, early systems
fundamentally different — perhaps due to systematic differences in metallicity, stellar initial
mass function, pressure, magnetic fields, and so-on? Ideally, one would like to understand
the internal conditions in more detail: the density and phase structure, chemistry and physical
distribution of the gas in high-redshift SMGs, where we use the label ‘SMG’ to broadly capture
extreme star-forming galaxies.
Most progress to date has been in the exploitation of strongly gravitationally lensed systems (e.g.
Koopmans et al., 2006; Swinbank et al., 2010; Conley et al., 2011; Wardlow et al., 2013; Dye
et al., 2015; Dessauges-Zavadsky et al., 2019; Rybak et al., 2020). For example, SMM J2135−0102
(z = 2.3), the so-called ‘Cosmic Eyelash’ (Swinbank et al., 2010) is one of the most comprehensively studied SMGs to date, and has provided valuable insights into the conditions of the ISM
in a galaxy with an SFR roughly 100× that of the Milky Way, close to the peak epoch of galaxy
growth (e.g. Ivison et al., 2010; Thomson et al., 2012; George et al., 2014).
Danielson et al. (2011, 2013) showed that the cold molecular gas associated with star formation
in the Cosmic Eyelash is exposed to UV radiation fields up to three orders of magnitude more

intense than that of the Solar neighbourhood, with the star-forming molecular gas having a characteristic density of 104 cm−3 , similar to values seen in local ultraluminous infrared galaxies
(Davies et al., 2003). Recent work on another well studied lensed system, SDP 81 (Rybak et al.,
2020), also suggests that a large fraction of the molecular ISM has been driven to high density,
with star-formation occurring throughout the galaxy, but localised in dense star-forming complexes of size ∼200 pc with conditions comparable to the Orion Trapezium cluster in the Milky
Way (see also Swinbank et al., 2015). We note, however, that the interpretation of ‘clumps’
detected in high resolution interferometric imaging needs to be treated with caution, with Ivison
et al. (2020) demonstrating that previously reported star-forming clumps in the Cosmic Eyelash
are in fact spurious artifacts, a result of over-cleaning of relatively low signal-to-noise data.
Targets like the Cosmic Eyelash and SDP 81 are valuable because their lens-amplified flux offers
a route to measure diagnostic tracers of the ISM and its conditions in a way that would be
impossible in the unlensed case. These targets are, however, intrinsically rare. Here we focus
on another strongly lensed SMG: ‘9io9’ (Geach et al., 2015). 9io9 is a galaxy discovered as
part of the citizen science project Spacewarps (see Marshall et al., 2016; More et al., 2016) and
independently as a bright millimetre source by Planck (Harrington et al., 2016), Herschel (Viero
et al., 2014), and the Atacama Cosmology Telescope (Su et al., 2017). 9io9 lies at z = 2.6, close

Chapter 2. [N II] at z = 2.6

42

to the peak epoch of galaxy growth (Geach et al., 2018). Even after taking into account the 15×
magnification factor, 9io9 appears to have a total infrared luminosity, LIR , exceeding 1013 L⊙ ,
putting in the hyperluminous class, with an inferred SFR of around 2000 M⊙ yr−1 , modulo the
sometimes high and often hidden AGN contribution to LIR in such systems (e.g. Ivison et al.,
2019), and also modulo evidence suggesting that the stellar initial mass function in high-density
star-forming regions is markedly top heavy (e.g. Romano et al., 2017; Zhang et al., 2018b;
Motte et al., 2018; Schneider et al., 2018; Brown and Wilson, 2019, cf. Romano et al. 2019). It
is therefore an excellent laboratory for studying the conditions of intense star formation in the
early Universe.
In this paper we present new observations of 9io9 with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA), building on the work of Geach et al. (2018). This study focuses on
the [N II] 122- and 205-µm fine-structure lines. These lines trace the cool, ionised ISM (Goldsmith et al., 2015), and together can be used to constrain the electron density (e.g. Zhang et al.,
2018a, and references therein). With previous ALMA CO J(4→3) and C I (1–0) observations
(Geach et al., 2018) this allows us to link the properties of the dense molecular and the ionised
phases of the ISM on identical scales in 9io9. In Section 2 we describe the observations and
data reduction, in Section 3 we present our analysis, in Section 4 we interpret and discuss the
main results of the analysis and present our conclusions in Section 5. Throughout we assume a
‘Planck 2015’ cosmology where H0 = 68 km s−1 Mpc−1 and Ωm = 0.31 (Planck Collaboration
et al., 2016).

Observations

9io9 (02h 09m 413, 00◦ 15′ 58′′ 5, z = 2.5543) was observed with the ALMA 12-m array in project
2017.1.00814.S in Bands 4, 8 and 9. The details of the Band 4 observations are presented in
Geach et al. (2018), and here we present the new Band 8 and 9 data. The Band 8 observations
were conducted on 2018 August 26 and 2018 September 07 in two 40-min execution blocks with
a representative frequency of approximately 411.5 GHz. The antenna configuration was C43–4
(with 47 antennas), with a maximum baseline of 783 m. The central frequencies of the four
spectral windows were 397.466, 399.404, 409.481 and 411.481 GHz, designed to cover the the
redshifted [N II] 3 P1 →3 P0 fine-structure line (νrest = 1461.131 GHz) and continuum emission.
Calibrators included J0217+0144, J0423−0120 and J2253+1608. In two executions the total

Chapter 2. [N II] at z = 2.6

43

on-source integration time was 42 min, with an average precipitable water vapor column of
0.73 mm, resulting in an r.m.s. noise of 3 mJy beam−1 in a 15.6-MHz channel.
The Band 9 observations were conducted on 2018 August 19 in a single 70-min execution
block. The antenna configuration was C43–3 (with 46 antennas), with a maximum baseline
of 484 m. The representative frequency was approximately 692.3 GHz with eight spectral windows at 670.311, 672.249, 674.249, 676.202, 686.248, 688.201, 690.200 and 692.138 GHz.
The Band 9 observations were designed to contain the redshifted [N II] 3 P2 →3 P1 fine-structure
line (νrest = 2459.380 GHz) and continuum emission. Calibrators included J0217+0144 and
J0522−3627. The total time on-source was 31 min, with an average precipitable water vapor
column of 0.45 mm, resulting in an r.m.s. noise of 10 mJy beam−1 in a 15.6-MHz channel.
For the Band 8 data we used the pipeline-restored calibrated measurement set. For the Band
9 observations, due to unstable phases in two antennas (DA64 and DA24) we re-calibrated
manually, flagging both dishes within the pipeline script. We imaged and cleaned the data using
the CASA (v.5.1.0-74.el7) task, tclean. As in Geach et al. (2018), we employ multi-scale
cleaning (at scales of 0′′ , 0.5′′ ,and, 1.25′′ ). First we produce dirty cubes to establish the r.m.s.
(1σ ) noise per channel, and then clean down to a threshold of 3σ . With natural weighting, the
synthesised beams were 0.43′′ × 0.35′′ (FWHM, position angle 33◦ ) and 0.32′′ × 0.28′′ (position
angle 74◦ ) in Bands 8 and 9, respectively. In order to produce data cubes that have closely
matched resolution across Band 4, 8 and 9, we also produce uv-tapered maps with a scale of
0.6′′ noting that the uv plane is well sampled across all bands such that we expect negligible
losses to extended emission on the scale of the lens (LAS ≲3–4′′ ). In Fig. 2.1 we present the
image-plane maps of the line-free Band 8 (400 GHz) and Band 9 (680 GHz) continuum emission
and the line-averaged [N II] 3 P1 →3 P0 and 3 P2 →3 P1 continuum-subtracted emission.

2.3

Analysis

2.3.1

Lens model

We adopt the same lens model as Geach et al. (2018). Briefly, the lens model includes the
gravitational potential of both the primary lensing galaxy (z ≈ 0.2) and its smaller northern
companion (assumed to be at the same redshift). The model uses the semi-linear inversion
method of Warren and Dye (2003) to reconstruct the source plane surface brightness that best

Chapter 2. [N II] at z = 2.6

44

matches the observed Einstein ring for a given lens model. This process is iterated, varying
the lens model and creating a source reconstruction at each iteration, until the global best fit
lens model is found (Geach et al., 2018). The best fit model was used to produce source-plane
cubes. Each slice was reconstructed with 50 realisations of a randomised Voronoi source plane
grid (see Dye et al., 2018, for further details) and the mean taken, weighted by the log of the
likelihood of each realisation. In Fig. 2.1 we show the equivalent continuum and line maps in
the source plane. The resulting source plane reconstruction has an average beam size of 280 mas
(FWHM) corresponding to a physical scale of 2.3 kpc in the source plane. Fig. 2.1 shows the
source-plane images of the line-free Band 8 (400 GHz) and Band 9 (680 GHz) continuum emission and the line-averaged [N II] 3 P1 →3 P0 and 3 P2 →3 P1 continuum-subtracted emission. As can
be seen in Figure 2.1, the [N II] 122µm line measured in Band 9 appears to have an additional
clump of emission to the NE not clearly visible (however detected) in the 205µm map. This
feature is multiply imaged in the image plane and also detected in the Band 8 data, so although
at low significance (3σ )) unlikely to be spurious. However due to a lack of a continuum detection and the low significance of the detection, the strength of the 122µm line in this region is
unreliable. There are several other low significance features that do correlate with emission in
other bands along the ring, but due to the relatively low signal-to-noise of the 122µm line we
do not attempt to interpret the resolved properties of the line itself, or the line ratio, concentrating our analysis on the integrated properties. Of course, with the 122µm line strength now
constrained, future observations could be obtained to address the resolved properties at higher
signal-to-noise. Fig. 2.2 shows the [N II] doublet as well as the C I (1–0) and CO J(4→3) lines,
scaled for comparison. In the following, all analysis is performed in the source plane. The errors
quoted for the intrinsic source properties do not include any systematic uncertainty introduced
by the prescribed parametric lens model (see e.g. Schneider and Sluse, 2013).

2.3.2

Line and continuum measurements

As we have resolved the global thermal dust continuum emission from 9io9 at high signal-tonoise in each of ALMA Bands 4, 8 and 9, with Band 9 probing close to the redshifted peak of the
thermal emission, we can estimate LIR (rest-frame 8–1000 µm) for the source, fully taking into
account the effects of differential lensing since LIR can be determined in the source plane. We
fit the observed emission with a single-temperature modified blackbody spectrum, allowing the
dust emissivity (β ), dust temperature (Td ) and normalisation to be free parameters. Summing
the luminosity within the region bound by the ≥3σ contour (in Band 8) we measure a total

Chapter 2. [N II] at z = 2.6

45

LIR = (1.1 ±0.2)×1013 L⊙ . Thus, 9io9 is a hyperluminous infrared-luminous galaxy (HyLIRG)
at z ≈ 2.6. For reference, the total Band 8 and Band 9 source plane continuum flux densities are
12 mJy and 43 mJy at observed frequencies of 400 and 680 GHz, respectively.
We evaluate line luminosities using the standard relation Solomon et al. (1997)

(2.1)

where DL is the luminosity distance, νobs is the observed frequency and S∆V is the velocityintegrated line flux. Subtracting the continuum model from each pixel based on a linear fit to
line free regions of the lines corresponding data cube allowing the gradient and normalisation
vary as free parameters, the integrated flux density measured within the same 3σ region as the
continuum (which was defined as the 3σ region in the Band 8 datacube) of the [N II] 205-µm
line is S∆V = (2.37 ± 0.06) Jy km s−1 , corresponding to L205 = (4.7 ± 0.1) × 108 L⊙ . For the
[N II] 122-µm line, the integrated flux density is S∆V = (7.6 ± 0.9) Jy km s−1 , corresponding
to L122 = (2.6 ± 0.3) × 109 L⊙ , integrating between −500 km s−1 and 300 km s−1 due to the
[N II] lines being incomplete. By comparing to the CO J(4→3) and C I (1–0) lines we estimate
we are missing ≈ 10% of the total line flux for both lines, however this should not alter the
resultant [N II] ratio as both lines are equally affected. Uncertainties are determined by adding
Gaussian noise to each channel, with a scale determined from off-source regions of the datacube,
taking the standard deviation of the pixel-to-pixel channel noise and scaling by the solid angle
subtended by the 3σ mask used to define the total emission. Repeating this 1000 times and
integrating the lines for each realisation allows us to estimate the uncertainties.

2.3.3

Electron density

With an ionisation potential of 14.5 eV, N+ originates exclusively from the ionised ISM. N+
thus traces H II regions and is a good tracer of massive star formation, with its emission being
directly related to the ionising photon rate and thus the number of massive stars (Zhao et al.,
2016b; Herrera-Camus et al., 2016). At lower densities (0.01 ≤ ne ≤ 0.1 cm−3 ), N+ is also a
coolant of the warm ionised medium (WIM).
N+ has three fine-structure levels: 3 P0,1,2 . These are simply referred to as 0, 1, 2 in the following.
If electron collisions are the primary excitation mechanism, we can write the collision rates as

[N II] doublet, C I (1–0) and CO J(4→3), scaled such that each line has a common mean (on an
arbitrary scale). All lines share a very similar double horned profile, indicating that the
molecular and ionized phases are broadly tracing the same structures.
Cij = Rij ne where Rij is the collision rate coefficient and ne is the electron density. Following
Goldsmith et al. (2015), the rate equations can be written

where n0 , n1 , and n2 are the populations of each level, such that n0 +n1 +n2 = n(N+ ), and Aij are
the Einstein coefficients. The 122- and 205-µm emission lines correspond to energy transitions
E21 and E10 , respectively. For optically thin emission these are related to the line intensity of the

F IGURE 2.3: Derived electron density versus [N II] line ratio

Derived electron density versus [N II] line ratio, including literature values found for a variety
of Galactic and extragalactic sources. Note the insensitivity of ne to the assumed electron
temperature.
There may be a potential bias in our measurement if the local radiation field is so intense that
optical pumping of [N II] provides a significant contribution to the excitation (Flannery et al.,
1979). We can test if this is likely to be important by comparing the pumping collision rate with
the inferred collision rate from our data. The pump rate can be expressed as Rp = 1835νUν ,
where νUν is a measure of the strength of the radiation field in erg cm−3 . In the Solar neighbourhood, νUν ≈ 7 × 10−14 erg cm−3 at ν ≈ 3 × 1015 Hz corresponding to the 3 D1 →3 P0 transition
(Draine, 2011). The interstellar UV radiation field in galaxies like 9io9 is not well constrained,
however Danielson et al. (2011) found for the Cosmic Eyelash that the cold gas was exposed to
a UV radiation field that is roughly 1000× that of the local Galactic ISM. If we assume similar
conditions for 9io9, then we obtain a pump rate of Rp ≈ 10−7 s−1 , or approximately 2 per cent of
the collision rate. Thus, even with rather extreme local radiation fields — perhaps only relevant
for the gas in the immediate vicinity of O and B stars — pumping has a negligible impact on the
[N II] excitation.

Interpretation and discussion

Recent studies of electron densities in the ISM of star-forming galaxies at high redshift using
optical/near-infrared (NIR) tracers of ne — such as O II and S II — have also found values
significantly higher than those typically observed in the local Universe, with ne ≳ 100 cm−3
not uncommon in samples of (Hα-selected) star-forming galaxies with SFR ∼ 1–100 s M⊙ yr−1
(Masters et al., 2014; Shirazi et al., 2014). Kaasinen et al. (2017) connected these elevated
electron densities to the high SFRs observed in galaxies at z ∼ 1–2, pointing out that the average
electron densities in their high-redshift and local samples are comparable, when controlled for
SFR. Shimakawa et al. (2015) and Jiang et al. (2019) note a correlation between the surface
density of star formation (ΣSFR ) and ne , providing further evidence of the close relationship
between star formation and ionised ISM density. This is not surprising, since if star formation
depends on the density distribution of the cold ISM, and ΣSFR is enhanced when a large fraction

Chapter 2. [N II] at z = 2.6

50

of the molecular ISM is driven to high density, then that will likely be reflected in the resultant
ionised phase density in the vicinity of those star-forming regions.
The integrated profiles of both [N II] lines resemble the integrated CO J(4→3) and C I (1–0)
line profiles (recall Fig. 2), indicating that the ionised and molecular tracers originate from the
same material and local environments. Geach et al. (2018) modelled the CO J(4→3) emission
with a rotating disk motivated by the dynamics of circumnuclear gas seen in local ULIRGs
(Downes and Solomon, 1998), and this provided an excellent fit to the data, with properties
similar to another stongly lensed system, SDP 81 (e.g. Partnership et al., 2015; Swinbank et al.,
2015; Dye et al., 2015; Hatsukade et al., 2015; Rybak et al., 2020). It is reasonable to assume
that the [N II] emission is tracing the ionised component of the ISM across the same disk, and
is broadly co-spatial with the star-forming molecular gas. The measured electron density of
−3 is significantly higher than that expected for the WIM, which is comprised
ne = 290+90
−70 cm

of material at densities 3–4 orders of magnitude lower (Gaensler et al., 2008; Weisberg et al.,
2008).
The electron density in 9io9 is high, but not extreme when we consider individual local starforming environments. For example, the Galactic H II region, G333.6−0.2, has an electron
density, ≈ 300 cm−3 , also determined via the [N II] ratio (Colgan et al., 1993). This is consistent with the conditions in 9io9, with the key difference that we are measuring the characteristic
electron density on scales of several kiloparsecs, rather than for an individual star-forming complex. Thus, a possible scenario is that star formation in 9io9 is proceeding in environments that
resemble ‘normal’ star-forming regions like G333.6−0.2 but with the key distinction that, while
G333.6−0.2 represents a tiny fraction of the total Milky Way ISM by mass and volume, in 9io9
the majority of the ISM may be in this state.
There is support for this ‘globally dense’ picture in the molecular phase tracers. Papadopoulos
and Geach (2012) argue that the CO J(4→3)/C I (1–0) ratio is an excellent empirical tracer of
the ratio of dense, actively star-forming molecular gas to the total molecular reservoir. Geach
et al. (2018) show that the observed ratio in 9io9 is consistent with over half of the molecular
ISM having been driven to high density. It follows that the H II regions produced by massive
star formation should have correspondingly elevated electron densities. Hints of this link can
be seen in Fig. 2.4, where we compare the CO J(4→3)/C I (1–0) ratio to the [N II] line ratio
for 9io9 and a sample of sources from the literature spanning a range of densities. Generally,
there is a weak trend that galaxies or regions with high electron densities — as traced by the

Chapter 2. [N II] at z = 2.6

51

[N II] line ratio — have a correspondingly high dense molecular gas fraction — as traced by the
CO J(4→3)/C I (1–0) ratio. This trend however is not significant given the current data, applying
a Pearsons-r test of significance, puts it at ≈ 1.5σ .
Given 9io9’s clear disk-like structure, most evident in the shape of the line profiles and confirmed
by the excellent fits achieved for disk- or ring-like kinematic models (Geach et al., 2018), we
can consider a detailed picture of star formation in this galaxy. A plausible scenario is that the
disk comprises an ensemble of dense clumps containing a large fraction of the total ISM, within
which star formation occurs. This is not a novel concept, of course. Early work with Hubble
Space Telescope suggested that a large fraction of star formation in high-redshift Lyman-break
galaxies may occur in large blue clumps, on scales of up to 1 kpc (e.g. Cowie et al., 1995;
Elmegreen et al., 2005). More recently, resolved imaging of strongly lensed dusty star-forming
systems suggests the presence of distinct regions of embedded high-density star formation on
scales of ∼100 pc, with luminosity densities comparable to the cores of local giant molecular
clouds (e.g. Swinbank et al., 2010, 2015; Hatsukade et al., 2015, though see Ivison et al. 2020).
This led to a ‘giant clump’ model of star formation in the most vigorously star-forming galaxies
at high redshift, where the 100 pc-scale clumps thought to be present in objects like the Cosmic
Eyelash resemble scaled-up versions of the dense, 1 pc-scale cores within local giant molecular
clouds.
The physical argument put forward to explain the formation of such structures is through disk instabilities, which don’t preclude but can conveniently circumvent the requirement for mergers or
interactions to drive gas to high densities, although interactions are known to be common — perhaps even ubiquitous — amongst SMGs (e.g. Engel et al., 2010). At high gas fractions and surface densities, disks will be Toomre-unstable (Toomre instability occurs when the gravitational
force overcomes the thermal pressure and shear forces associated with a differentially rotating disk) and undergo local collapse, fragmenting into multiple star forming regions. (Toomre,
1964; Noguchi, 1999; Dekel et al., 2009b). The gas densities and velocity dispersions typically
inferred in objects like the Cosmic Eyelash, SDP 81 and 9io9, would give rise to a Jeans length
scale on which this fragmentation occurs that is broadly consistent with the ≈100 pc clump
scales described above (e.g. Swinbank et al., 2015; Hatsukade et al., 2015)2 . The current source
plane resolution in 9io9 is around 300 pc and so we cannot yet address this question; however,
the brightness of the target (approaching 1 Jy) makes it a prime candidate for pushing to very
2 Note that in the case of the Cosmic Eyelash Ivison et al. (2020) have shown these clumps to be spurious — the
result of over-cleaning a low-signal-to-noise interferometric image.

long baselines to resolve the disk sub-structure, allowing us to link the physical conditions of the
ISM explored here on global scales to the spatial distribution of the gas down to 10s of parsecs.

2.5

Conclusions

We have reported new ALMA Band 8 and 9 observations of a strongly lensed HyLIRG at z = 2.6,
targeting the [N II] fine-structure line emission and thermal continuum in the rest-frame farinfrared waveband. Our main findings are as follows:

• We report detections of both the 122- and 205-µm [N II] emission lines, which trace the
ionised ISM. The [N II] lines match the double-horned line profiles seen in CO J(4→3)
and C I (1–0), reported by Geach et al. (2018) and well-modelled by a rotating disk. This
implies that the ionised gas is broadly co-located with the molecular material on scales of
several kiloparsecs.
• We use the 122/205µm line ratio to estimate the average electron density in the ISM,
finding ne ≈ 300 cm−3 , an order of magnitude above that of the (average) Milky Way,
comparable with measurements of the electron density in discrete Galactic star-forming
environments.
• We find a tentative trend (≈ 1.5σ ) between the ratio of dense molecular gas and the total
molecular gas reservoir, as traced by CO J(4→3) and C I (1–0), and the [N II] line ratio.
If the former is a tracer of the dense molecular gas fraction as Papadopoulos and Geach
(2012) argue, then the correlation with the [N II] ratio and therefore ionised gas density
reveals a picture of ‘globally dense’ ISM, where a significant fraction of the molecular
component has been driven to high density — possibly through violent disk instabilities,
with or without galaxy interactions — with myriad individual H II regions dominating the
observed [N II] emission.

9io9 is a remarkably extreme system, fortuitously lensed to provide us a glimpse of its inner
workings. Our findings support a picture where the nature of star formation in this galaxy might
not necessarily differ from the conditions of star formation in our own Milky Way. The key difference is that a far higher fraction of the ISM is currently participating in that star formation.

Abstract
We report the detection of the ground state rotational emission of ammonia, ortho-NH3 (JK =
10 → 00 ) in a gravitationally lensed, intrinsically hyperluminous, star-bursting galaxy at z = 2.6.
The integrated line profile is consistent with other molecular and atomic emission lines which
have resolved kinematics well-modelled by a 5 kpc-diameter rotating disc. This implies that the
gas responsible for NH3 emission is broadly tracing the global molecular reservoir, but likely
distributed in pockets of high density (n ≳ 5 × 104 cm−3 ). With a luminosity of 2.8 × 106 L⊙ , the
NH3 emission represents 2.5 × 10−7 of the total infrared luminosity of the galaxy, comparable
to the ratio observed in the Kleinmann-Low nebula in Orion and consistent with sites of massive
star formation in the Milky Way. If LNH3 /LIR serves as a proxy for the ‘mode’ of star formation,
this hints that the nature of star formation in extreme starbursts in the early Universe is similar
to that of Galactic star-forming regions, with a large fraction of the cold interstellar medium in
this state, plausibly driven by a storm of violent disc instabilities in the gas-dominated disc. This
supports the ‘full of Orions’ picture of star formation in the most extreme galaxies seen close to
the peak epoch of stellar mass assembly.

Introduction

The progenitors of the most massive galaxies today are most likely the population of intense
star-bursting galaxies seen at z ≳ 2 (Smail et al., 1997; Hughes et al., 1998). These starbursts
have large gas reservoirs (Bothwell et al., 2013) representing a significant fraction of baryonic
mass (Wiklind et al., 2019) fuelling very high rates of star formation, possibly up to three orders
of magnitude greater than the Milky Way (Chapman et al., 2004; Barger et al., 2014).
Generally, these gas- and dust-rich systems are obscured in the optical, but radiate strongly in
the submillimetre and millimetre through their thermal dust emission. Indeed, the emission
from key molecular and atomic tracers of the cool and cold dense interstellar medium (ISM)
responsible for fuelling star formation, and its immediate environment is also observed at these
wavelengths.
Two key factors have improved our understanding of the nature of these distant, dusty, prodigiously star-forming galaxies over the past decade. One is the identification of large samples of
strongly gravitationally lensed systems (e.g. Danielson et al., 2013; Spilker et al., 2014; Rybak
et al., 2015; Geach et al., 2015; Rybak et al., 2020). Lensing amplifies flux, revealing emission
features otherwise too faint to detect, and magnifies images of galaxies to provide access to
spatial scales not achievable by any other means (Rybak et al., 2015; Geach et al., 2018; Rybak et al., 2020). The second is the advent of sensitive, wide bandwidth interferometry across
the submillimetre–millimetre using large interferometric arrays, in particular the Atacama Large
Millimetre/submillimetre Array (ALMA). The follow-up of lensed galaxies with ALMA has accelerated the establishment of a clearer, albeit still incomplete, picture of the nature of galaxies
undergoing intense starbursts in the early Universe.
What astrophysics is responsible for the existence of extreme starbursts at high-z? Compared
to the merger-dominated ultra luminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) in the local universe with
intense circumnuclear star formation, high-z starbursts of equivalent luminosity appear to be
sustaining star formation across much larger scales Rujopakarn et al. (2011).
Mergers undoubtedly play a role in the triggering high-z starbursts (Tacconi et al., 2010; Engel
et al., 2010), but there is some observational evidence that some of the most intensely starforming galaxies are simply consistent with large gas-dominated rotationally supported discs
(Hodge et al., 2016; Jiménez-Andrade et al., 2018; Geach et al., 2018; Gullberg et al., 2018).
In these systems a significant fraction of the ISM appears to have been driven to high density

F IGURE 3.1: Maps and spectra for NH3 and CO(5–4)

Maps and spectra for the NH3 and CO(5–4) emission in 9io9. (left) Maps show the
continuum-subtracted image plane emission averaged over the line with contours shown for the
fainter NH3 starting at 3σ . Synthesised beams are indicated top right. (right) Spectra show the
source-integrated emission, with the much brighter CO line acting as a reference profile that
can be directly compared with the weaker NH3 , where we overlay a scaled version of the
CO(5–4) line to demonstrate the strong similarity between the line profiles, despite NH3
generally tracing much denser gas (see Section 4 for a discussion). We bin the NH3 spectrum
to ∼50 km s−1 channels for visualisation purposes. The ‘dip’ in NH3 emission at ∼100 km s−1
is not a significant feature (≈ 2σ ).
(Oteo et al., 2017; Geach et al., 2018; Doherty et al., 2020), possibly via violent disc instabilities (VDIs, e.g. Toomre, 1964; Dekel et al., 2009a,b), and in this case the extreme star formation
rates measured can naturally be explained by the sheer quantity of gas available for active participation in star formation (Geach and Papadopoulos, 2012; Papadopoulos and Geach, 2012).
We can learn more about the actual conditions of the star-forming ISM, and the conditions of
star formation in general by exploiting gravitational lensing to study the astrochemistry of these
systems (Danielson et al., 2011; Spilker et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2018b; Dye et al., 2022). If
the density distribution of the cold molecular reservoir is important for driving globally high star
formation rates, then observations of species that trace the densest environments are required,
particularly heavy rotor molecules (Oteo et al., 2017; Béthermin et al., 2018).
In this work we report the detection of the ground state emission line of ammonia (NH3 ) in a
(now well-studied) strongly lensed starburst galaxy at z = 2.6. A tracer of the dense molecular
ISM and intimately linked to the sites of star formation, NH3 was the first polyatomic molecule

Chapter 3. NH3 at z = 2.6

57

detected in the ISM (Cheung et al., 1968) and is amongst the most studied species in the local
universe, primarily through its radio inversion lines (Ott et al., 2011; Schmidt et al., 2016; Fehér
et al., 2022). The ground state NH3 (JK = 10 → 00 ) ortho line emits at 572.498 GHz in the rest
frame, and therefore any ground-based studies of this feature at z = 0 are hampered by the nearzero transmission of the atmosphere at this frequency. In Section 2 we present the observations
and data reduction, in Section 3 we present our analysis and results, and in Sections 4 and 5 we
provide our interpretation and conclusions. Throughout we assume a ‘Planck 2015’ cosmology
where H0 = 68 km s−1 Mpc−1 and Ωm = 0.31 (Planck Collaboration et al., 2016).

3.2

Observations and data reduction

9io9 (J2000, 02h 09m 413, 00◦ 15′ 58′′ 5, z = 2.5543) was observed with the ALMA 12 m array during project 2019.1.01365.S. The C43-3 configuration was used, employing 48 antennas with baseline separations of 15–784 m. We executed a spectral scan in Band 4 across
νobs = 152.5–162.9 GHz with a total on-source time of approximately 195 minutes over five
executions. The precipitable water vapour column was 1.9–3.5 mm and the average system
temperature was Tsys = 69–91 K over the five executions. Atmosphere, bandpass, phase and
pointing calibrators included the sources J0423−0120 and J0217+0144. We use the pipelinerestored calibrated measurement set for imaging. We image and CLEANed the data using CASA
(v.5.1.0-74.el7) tclean with multiscale cleaning at scales of 0′′ , 0.5′′ , and 1.25′′ . First we produce dirty cubes to establish the r.m.s. (1σ ) noise per channel, and then cleaned down to a
stopping threshold of 3σ . With natural weighting, and setting a common beam to the whole
datacube, the synthesized beam has a full width at half maximum of 1.3′′ × 1.0′′ (position angle
72◦ ). The r.m.s. noise per 10 MHz (20 km s−1 ) channel is 0.3 mJy beam−1 .
We adopt the same lens model as Geach et al. (2018). Briefly, the lens model includes the
gravitational potential of both the primary lensing galaxy (z ≈ 0.2) and its smaller northern
companion (assumed to be at the same redshift). The model uses the semi-linear inversion
method of Warren and Dye (2003) to reconstruct the source plane surface brightness that best
matches the observed Einstein ring for a given lens model. This process is iterated, varying the
lens model and creating a source reconstruction at each iteration, until the global best fit lens
model is found (Geach et al., 2018). The best fit model is used to produce source-plane cubes.
In the following, we use the source-plane cube to extract the integrated spectrum, accounting for

Chapter 3. NH3 at z = 2.6

58

magnification of the sources of line emission. However, due to the relatively coarse resolution
and signal to noise of the data, we present maps of 9io9 in the image plane.

3.3

Results

We use Splatalogue (Remijan et al., 2007) to identify emission lines in the total spectrum. CO
J = 5 → 4 at νobs = 162.133 GHz is detected at high significance as expected, and exhibits the
characteristic double horned profile as other molecular and atomic lines (Geach et al., 2015,
2018; Harrington et al., 2019; Doherty et al., 2020), and well-modelled in the source-plane
reconstruction by a rotating disc (Geach et al., 2018). We also detect a fainter, but significant,
emission feature at νobs = 161.072 GHz that is consistent with the redshifted ground state orthoNH3 JK = 10 → 00 rotational line at νrest = 572.498 GHz (Cazzoli et al., 2009, hereafter we refer
to the line as NH3 ). Image plane integrated spectra of the CO J = 5 → 4 (hereafter CO(5–4))
and NH3 lines and maps are presented in Figure 3.1. To our knowledge, the previous highest
redshift detection of this transition of ammonia was in absorption in a spiral galaxy at z = 0.89,
where the galaxy is acting as a lens, magnifying the strong (sub)millimeter continuum emission
of the famous background quasar PKS 1830−211 at z = 2.51 (Menten et al., 2008; Muller et al.,
2014).
To measure the line properties, we subtract continuum emission on a pixel-by-pixel basis, using a simple linear fit to the spectrum in line-free regions around NH3 . We then model the
integrated line emission using an empirical template based on the high SNR CO(5–4) emission
line. By simply shifting the position of the CO(5–4) emission in frequency space and scaling its
amplitude, we can minimise the χ 2 difference between the scaled CO(5–4) and the NH3 line.
Figure 3.1 shows how the scaled CO(5–4) line provides an excellent fit to the NH3 emission. We
discuss the implications of this later. The total integrated line flux is evaluated by summing the
flux within an aperture defined by the 3σ contour of the averaged band 4 data cube. We measure
µLNH3 = (3.3 ± 0.2) × 107 L⊙ , where µ is the lensing magnification. To estimate uncertainties
in this procedure, we simply add Gaussian noise to each channel, with a σ determined from the
r.m.s. in off-source regions of the data cube and then repeat the fit 1000 times. Applying this
same procedure to the source plane reconstructions, we obtain a source plane line luminosity of
LNH3 = (2.8 ± 0.2) × 106 L⊙ . If instead of using the scaled CO(5–4) as a model of the emission,
we just integrate over the range ∆V = ±500 km s−1 , we obtain a source plane luminosity of
LNH3 = (3.1 ± 0.3) × 106 L⊙ .

Interpretation

As can be seen from Figure 3.1, the scaled CO(5–4) emission is an excellent description of the
NH3 line emission. In turn, the line profile of the integrated, projected CO emission is well
modelled by a nearly edge-on rotating disc (when modelled in the source plane and projected
into the image plane) and this profile is shared by the majority of detected lines within this
system covering a wide range of conditions, from the relatively low density molecular reservoir
traced by C I (1–0) to the warmer, dense, ionised gas traced by N+ (Su et al., 2017; Geach et al.,
2018; Harrington et al., 2019; Doherty et al., 2020). The striking similarity in the observed line
profiles imply that the observed NH3 emission is broadly co-located with the CO-emitting gas,
likely emanating from discrete sites of on-going star formation scattered throughout the gas-rich
disc.
Ho and Townes (1983) note that NH3 is a rather ubiquitous molecule, tracing a broad range of
interstellar environments containing molecular gas. However, for the rotational transitions in
the millimetre, NH3 is expected to trace dense gas. In the optically thin limit, the critical density of NH3 is ncrit ≳ 107 cm3 for kinetic temperatures Tk < 100 K (Shirley, 2015). In realistic
scenarios, the NH3 emission will be optically thick, and therefore subject to radiative trapping
(Draine, 2011). This serves to lower the effective critical density, but even so, the effective densities for optically thick NH3 emission are still probing dense gas, with neff ≳ 5 × 104 cm3 for
Tk < 100 K and assuming a column density commensurate with dense gas clumps and cores in
the Milky Way (log10 (Nref /cm−2 ) = 14.3, Shirley (2015)). However, the effective density will
further scale down with increasing column density as Nref /N. Another caveat is the presence
of significant far-infrared background fields, which will be dominated by the ambient radiation
field of the galaxy itself due to dust emission, with the most intense emission likely co-located
with the dense star-forming gas. This background could lead to significant radiative pumping
of NH3 molecule and therefore a non-collisional route to rotational emission; indeed Schmidt
et al. (2016) discuss the potential role of pumping of the NH3 rotational ground state emission
as a solution to the discrepancy between the abundances derived via the NH3 ground state and
its radio inversion lines in some local systems. While radiative pumping would further serve to
lower the effective density of the gas responsible for NH3 emission, we can be reasonably confident that the observed NH3 is tracing some of the densest molecular gas in 9io9, and therefore
the actual sites of star formation.

Can we relate the properties of 9io9 to local star formation? Doherty et al. (2020) show that the
average electron density (ne ≈ 300 cm−3 ) associated with warm ionised gas as traced by N+ finestructure emission is consistent with the typical density of Galactic star-forming regions. The
conclusion is that the conditions are not ‘extreme’ compared to sites of active star formation
in the Milky Way, but clearly a larger fraction of the ISM is participating in star formation in
9io9 and galaxies like it compared to the Milky Way. What of the efficiency, or ‘mode’ of star
formation? A crude approach is to compare proxies for the star formation rate and dense gas that
is fuelling it; more efficient star formation is characterised by a higher rate per unit dense gas
mass, with a theoretical upper limit set by the Eddington limit (Murray et al., 2005). With the
integrated infrared luminosity as a proxy for the total star formation rate (for galaxies dominated
by dust) and NH3 as a tracer of the dense molecular gas actively participating in star formation,
we can use LIR /LNH3 as an empirical tracer of the star formation efficiency. In 9io9 we measure
LNH3 = 2.8 × 106 L⊙ and luminosity of LIR = 1.1 × 1013 L⊙ , yielding LNH3 /LIR ≈ 3 × 10−7 .
There are relatively few regions where we have robust and integrated infrared luminosities.
One such region, the Kleinmann–Low nebula in Orion (Orion-KL) – a dense, hot molecular
cloud core close to the Trapezium cluster, which excites the Orion Nebula – is frequently used
as a local benchmark in many studies, not the least because of its proximity at ∼400 pc. With
LIR ∼ 8 × 104 L⊙ (Gezari et al., 1998) and LNH3 ≈ 0.01L⊙ (Olofsson et al., 2007; Persson et al.,
2007), Orion-KL has LNH3 /LIR ≈ 1.3 × 10−7 , within a factor of a few of the ‘global’ 9io9 ratio,
despite eight orders of magnitude separating the infrared luminosities.
While the Orion molecular clouds have been extensively studied (e.g. Genzel and Stutzki, 1989),
we note that it has been argued that the energetics of Orion-KL are not dominated by high
mass star formation, but rather by an explosive stellar merger event (Zapata et al., 2011). Although one would expect a correspondingly high density of supernovae in 9io9, Orion-KL is
arguably not a typical region in which presently high mass stars are forming. In contrast W31 C

(G10.6−4) (LIR ∼106 L⊙ ) and the ‘mini-starburst’ W49 N (LIR ∼107 L⊙ Wright et al., 1977) are
luminous Galactic high-mass star-forming regions located at distances of 4.8 kpc and 11.2 kpc,
for which observations of the line have been published (Persson et al., 2010, 2011). Toward
both sources, the spectra were taken as part of the Herschel key guaranteed time project PRISMAS1 using the Heterodyne Instrument for the Far-Infrared (HIFI). Unlike the corresponding
para-NH3 lines, which show almost exclusively absorption, toward both W49 N and W31 C,
the spectra of the ortho- line is far more complex, displaying strong emission at the velocities
of the background sources with self-absorption features slightly offset from the systemic velocities (Figure 3.2). We model the emission by fitting Gaussian profiles centred at the systemic
velocity of each source with the line widths optimised to fit the emission wings. Subsequently,
the self-absorption features modelled using narrower Gaussian profiles centred at 0 km s−1 and
13 km s−1 for W31 C and W49 N, respectively, are removed. The resulting fits are then used to
derive integrated line intensities of 6.33 K km s−1 and 1.33 K km s−1 for W31 C and W49 N,
respectively. Using a conversion factor of 482 Jy/K this yields line luminosities LNH3 = 0.042L⊙
and LNH3 = 0.048L⊙ , and LNH3 /LIR of 4.2 × 10−8 and 4.8 × 10−8 toward W31 C and W49 N,
respectively. The NH3 line luminosities should be considered lower limits due to uncertainties
in the line intensities estimated and the nature of the observed self-absorption. If there is significant self-absorption of the NH3 emission when averaged over galaxy scales in 9io9, then
our measured luminosity could also be considered a lower limit. In Table 3.1 and Figure 3.3
we compare the luminosity ratios we derive for the Galactic sources with 9io9. The ratios are
broadly consistent within a factor of a few, despite the fact that the 9io9 measurement is galaxyintegrated across a system with an overall rate of star formation several orders of magnitude
greater than the Milky Way.

Conclusions

The actual structure of star-forming regions in gas-dominated, high-redshift discs such as 9io9
remains unclear. While some studies have argued for the presence of ‘giant clumps’ with properties similar to the cores of local Giant Molecular Clouds, but scaled up to sizes of order 100 pc
(e.g. Rybak et al., 2015; Hatsukade et al., 2015), others have pointed out that the reality of such
features is questionable, and that star formation may well be smoother, or structured on smaller

scales than can be reliably imaged interferometrically, even with the assistance of lensing (Ivison et al., 2020). Regardless, it is evident that in order to drive globally elevated star formation,
a large fraction of the cold ISM must be driven to high densities.
The introduction of supersonic turbulence is a key mechanism to achieve high gas density
fractions (Geach and Papadopoulos, 2012), with the dispersion of the log-normal distribution
describing the molecular gas density sensitive to the 1-dimensional average Mach number:
M = σv /cs , with σv the gas velocity dispersion and cs the speed of sound in the medium
(Padoan and Nordlund, 2002). In the local Universe, mergers drive up M (e.g. Narayanan
et al., 2011), and is the primary mechanism for ultraluminous emission in galaxies (Solomon
and Vanden Bout, 2005). 9io9 – like many other high redshift starbursts – does not appear to be
undergoing a major merger (although see Liu et al., 2022), but VDIs (Dekel et al., 2009b; Inoue
et al., 2016) are a viable alternative mechanism for locally driving up M resulting in pockets of
high-density gas, and therefore star formation, across the gas-dominated disc. Confirming this in

Chapter 3. NH3 at z = 2.6

64

practice will require reliable high-resolution imaging (noting the caveat referenced above for interferometric data) that could map out the relative distribution of dense molecular gas compared
to the bulk reservoir. It is important to note that minor mergers and interactions can catalyse
VDIs (e.g. Swinbank et al., 2011; Saha and Cortesi, 2018).
That a large fraction of the molecular ISM in 9io9 resembles environments like Orion-KL and
other Galactic environments, with the broad kinematics of NH3 consistent with ordered disc
rotation across the full range of molecular gas densities, we can picture an ensemble of millions
of ‘Orion-KLs’ embedded throughout the compact disc of 9io9; perhaps individually unremarkable, but en masse driving globally high star formation. This echos the evocative picture Rybak
et al. (2020) present of another dusty, star-forming lensed galaxy, SDP.81 (z ≈ 3): they describe
the system as ‘full of Orions’, based on the similarity of the ISM conditions on sub-kpc scales
in SDP.81 compared to Orion. Our results appear to support this picture, and highlight the utility of the fainter, heavy rotor tracers in revealing the structure of the high-density ISM that is
physically proximate with active star formation in young massive galaxies.

galaxy: implications for the stellar
initial mass function in distant
starbursts

Abstract
We present new Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array (ALMA) observations of the
lensed hyperluminous starburst galaxy ‘9io9’ at z = 2.554, detecting CO J=5→4 and its isotopologues 13 CO J=5→4 and C18 O J=5→4. Since 13 C is mainly produced by intermediatemass stars and 18 O is produced by massive stars, 13 CO/C18 O is sensitive to the shape of the
stellar initial mass function (IMF), where the IMF of the Milky Way has a power law slope
α2 ≈ 2.3–2.6 for stars of masses above 0.5 M⊙ . We measure a galaxy-integrated luminosity
ratio 13 CO/C18 O = 1.6 ± 0.1, consistent with the ratio observed in local ultraluminous infrared
galaxies and submillimetre-selected galaxies at high redshift, and significantly lower than the
13 CO/C18 O of the Milky Way. It has been argued that the low 13 CO/C18 O observed in extreme

star-forming galaxies in the early Universe is evidence for a top-heavy IMF in these systems.
In this work we use state-of-the-art chemical evolution models to conclude that irrespective of
stellar rotation, the observed 13 CO/C18 O is consistent with a Kroupa IMF with high-mass slope
of α2 = 2.3 (as in our Milky Way models) and also the steeper ’top-heavy’ α2 = 2.1 slope.

Introduction

For decades, star formation in high-redshift galaxies has been assumed to follow a Milky Waylike stellar initial mass function (IMF, Salpeter, 1955; Kroupa, 2001; Chabrier, 2003). Under
this assumption, the population of submillimetre-selected galaxies (SMGs), and indeed dusty
star-forming galaxies (DSFGs) in general at z > 1 are predicted to have star-formation rates
(SFRs) of 1000 M⊙ yr−1 or more (e.g. Smail et al., 1997; Hughes et al., 1998; Barger et al.,
2014). Those at the highest redshifts (e.g. Riechers et al., 2013; Fudamoto et al., 2017) can
therefore assemble a large fraction of their stellar mass very quickly in the early Universe (e.g.
Oteo et al., 2017; Miller et al., 2018). Indeed, there is evidence for the rapid accumulation of
passive galaxies in proto-clusters by z ≈ 3 (e.g. McConachie et al., 2022). Clearly SMGs and
the like represent some of the most luminous galaxies in the Universe, but models of galaxy

formation have often struggled to reproduce galaxies with such extreme SFRs (e.g. Baugh et al.,
2005; Swinbank et al., 2008; Davé et al., 2010; Hayward et al., 2013, cf. Lovell et al. 2021).
This motivates investigations of the true nature of star formation in these systems.
The stellar IMF describes the abundance of stars of different mass and is typically parameterised as a broken power law. For the Milky Way, this takes the form ξ (m) = m−α , with
α = 0.8, 1.3, 2.3 for stellar masses M < 0.08, 0.08–0.5 and ≥ 0.5 M⊙ , respectively (Kroupa,
2001), though other formulations exist and some argue that α2 = 2.7 is required at M ≥ 0.5 M⊙
to avoid over-producing metals (e.g. Romano et al., 2005). Generally, if the IMF is described as
being ‘top heavy’, this means it has a high abundance of massive (typically meaning M > 8 M⊙ )
stars relative to the Milky Way, with the corollary that there is still debate on the nature of the
Galactic IMF. In any case, increasing the relative abundance of high mass stars means that a
lower SFR is required to generate a given luminosity. The conditions within SMGs are certainly
different from the Milky Way, where the properties of their interstellar medium (ISM) and its

Chapter 4. 13 CO/C18 O in a hyperluminous galaxy

69

incident radiation field – the dramatically higher cosmic ray flux, for example – are expected to
play an important role in shaping the IMF (e.g. Padoan and Nordlund, 2002; Krumholz, 2006;
Bate, 2009; Hopkins, 2013; Bisbas et al., 2015, 2017).
There is some evidence from the local Universe that the IMF becomes top heavy in intensely
star-forming environments (e.g. Motte et al., 2018; Pouteau et al., 2022). For example, in 30 Doradus, sometimes taken as an analogue to the low-metallicity, starbursting conditions of some
high-redshift galaxies, Schneider et al. (2018) present evidence for a 32 ± 12 per cent overabundance of stars with M > 30 M⊙ relative to a Salpeter IMF (Salpeter, 1955). If the IMF in
luminous galaxies at large redshifts is different – more top-heavy – to the Milky Way, then this
has profound consequences for our understanding of the star formation history of the Universe.
If SMGs are the progenitors of the most massive elliptical galaxies today, having formed a large
fraction of their stars in conditions where a different IMF applied, then the surviving, low mass
population of stars in their descendants should give us insight as a ‘fossil record’ (e.g. Smith
et al., 2017). Confusingly, this archaeological evidence suggests that the central stellar populations of local ellipticals formed from a bottom-heavy IMF, at least for M < 1 M⊙ , with shallower
slopes preferred at M > 1 M⊙ (see Smith, 2020, for a review).
Counting stars or young stellar objects, which is the most direct method for actually measuring
the IMF, becomes impossible at cosmological distances. Alternative, indirect methods are required. A promising technique exploits the chemical signature imprinted on the ISM by massive
stars. In particular, the 13 C/18 O abundance ratio is expected to be sensitive to the shape of the
IMF, because 18 O is primarily produced in stars with M > 8 M⊙ , whereas 13 C is produced in
low- and intermediate-mass stars (4–7 M⊙ , Kobayashi et al., 2011). After deposition in the ISM,
these isotopes become locked into the isotopologues of the abundant and readily observable CO
molecule, whose rotational transitions are accessible in the sub-mm/mm window across nearly
all of cosmic history.
Zhang et al. (2018b) measured 13 CO/C18 O in a sample of lensed (note that the isotopologue
emission is intrinsically faint) z ≈ 2–3 SMGs, finding a value close to unity, similar to that
found in local ultraluminous infrared galaxies (ULIRGs) and an order of magnitude below typical star-forming disks like the Milky Way. The trend of increasing contribution from C18 O
with increasing LIR (and therefore SFR) hints at a systematic variation in the abundance of 18 O
in the intensely star-forming environments of SMGs. Using the chemical evolution model of
Romano et al. (2017), which is benchmarked on the Milky Way Zhang et al. (2018b) argued

Chapter 4. 13 CO/C18 O in a hyperluminous galaxy

70

that the 13 CO/C18 O ratios of around unity observed in local ULIRGs and high-redshift SMGs
are evidence of a top-heavy IMF, at least in their current starbursts. Romano et al. (2019) updated this analysis to include new chemical yields for massive stars with rotation (Limongi and
Chieffi, 2018), finding that SMGs require a top-heavy (α2 < 2.7) IMF if the conditions of their
ISM favour the formation of rapidly rotating stars. In contrast, a universal IMF can suffice if
conditions are unfavourable to the formation of massive stellar fast-rotators. However, clearly
a larger sample is required to build up a more representative picture of 13 CO/C18 O in SMGs at
the same epoch.
Here we present a measurement of 13 CO/C18 O in another strongly lensed SMG, known as 9io9,
at z = 2.6 (Geach et al., 2015, 2018; Doherty et al., 2020) with the Atacama Large Millimetre/submillimetre Array (ALMA). Even after correcting for lensing magnification, 9io9 is an intrinsically hyperluminous galaxy, with LIR > 1013 L⊙ . The bulk of this luminosity is associated with
star formation across a 2.5 kpc disk (Geach et al., 2018), and therefore it is an excellent example
of (apparently) rapid stellar assembly in a gas-rich rotation dominated system close to the peak
of galaxy formation where lensing provides access to emission lines otherwise inaccessible or
prohibitively expensive to observe. In §2, we present the observations and data reduction; in
§3, we present our results and analysis; in §4, we put forward our interpretation and discussion
and conclude in §5. Throughout we assume a cosmology where H0 = 68 km s−1 Mpc−1 and
Ωm = 0.31 (Planck Collaboration et al., 2016).

4.2

Observations and data reduction

9io9 (02h 09m 413, 00◦ 15′ 58′′ 5, z = 2.5543) was observed with the ALMA 12-m array as part of
project 2019.1.01365.S. The C43-3 configuration was used, employing 48 antennas with baseline separations of 15–784 m. We executed a spectral scan in ALMA band 4 across νobs =
152.5–162.9 GHz, designed to span the 12 CO, 13 CO and C18 O J = 5 → 4 lines, with five executions and a total resulting on-source time of ≈ 195 min. The precipitable water vapour column
was 1.9–3.5 mm and the system temperature ranged across Tsys = 69–91 K for the five executions. Flux density, bandpass and phase calibrators included J0423−0120 and J0217+0144.
We started from the calibrated measurement set produced by the ALMA Science Pipeline. We
imaged and cleaned the data using tclean, part of CASA (v.5.1.0-74.el7), with multi-scale
cleaning at scales of 0′′ , 0.5′′ and 1.25′′ . First, we produced dirty cubes to establish the r.m.s.

(1σ ) noise per channel, and then we cleaned down to a stopping threshold of 3σ . With natural weighting, setting a common beam for the whole datacube, the synthesised beam had a
full width at half maximum (FWHM) of 1.3′′ × 1.0′′ (at position angle, 72◦ ). The r.m.s. noise
per 10 MHz (20 km s−1 ) channel was 0.3 mJy beam−1 . In Fig. 1 we present our cleaned images
of the 12 CO, 13 CO and C18 O J = 5 → 4 emission, in the image plane, as well as the galaxyintegrated spectrum.

4.3

Results

Since a reliable lens model exists for 9io9 (see Geach et al., 2018, for details), we apply the
lens inversion to produce a source-plane datacube. All subsequent analysis is performed in the
source plane.
We use Splatalogue (Remijan et al., 2007) to identify emission lines in the integrated spectrum.
As well as CO emission lines, we identify H2 O, HNC, NH3 , and H18
2 O (see Fig. 4.1). These will
be the subject of future analysis (Doherty et al., in prep). As expected, the strongest spectral
feature is 12 CO J = 5–4, which has the same characteristic double-horned profile observed previously in 12 CO J = 4–3, C I 1–0 and [N II] (Geach et al., 2018; Doherty et al., 2020). The C18 O
J = 5–4 line is blended with H18
2 O but the majority of lines share the same characteristic profile
in the integrated spectrum so following Doherty et al. (2022) we use the high signal-to-noise
CO J=5→4 line – which is not blended with other lines – as an empirical template that can be
13
shifted and re-normalised to deblend the C18 O J = 5–4 and H18
2 O emission. Although CO is

not blended with another line, we also model it with the 12 CO template.
We subtract continuum emission on a pixel-by-pixel basis, using a simple linear fit to the spectrum in line-free regions. Next, we model the CO J=5→4 line with a cubic spline with the
smoothing parameter set to the noise scale. This is used to create the template for de-blending,
which we use as a model for the two isotopologues of interest and their neighbouring lines, assuming all lines are at z = 2.554. After fixing the template spectrum to the redshifted frequency
of each line, we scale the amplitude of the template, minimising the χ 2 residual between the
scaled template and the data. Fig. 2 shows the best fits for the 13 CO and C18 O lines. To estimate uncertainties on the fits we add Gaussian noise to each channel, with a scale determined
from off-source regions of the datacube. We take the standard deviation of the pixel-to-pixel
channel noise and scale by the solid angle subtended by the 3σ contour used to define the total

Chapter 4. 13 CO/C18 O in a hyperluminous galaxy

72

emission. We repeat the fitting procedure 1,000 times for each realisation to estimate the 1σ
uncertainty of the model normalisation (and therefore velocity integrated flux S∆V ) for each
line. We evaluate line luminosities by integrating S∆V for each de-blended emission line, then
scale by the luminosity distance. We measure integrated fluxes of 1.41 ± 0.05, 0.96 ± 0.06 and
30.5 ± 0.3 Jy km s−1 for the 13 CO, C18 O and 12 CO emission lines, respectively. These correspond to luminosities of L13 CO = (1.05 ± 0.04) × 108 L⊙ , LC18 O = (7.10 ± 0.50) × 107 L⊙ and
L12 CO = (2.37 ± 0.03) × 109 L⊙ , respectively, using the standard relation found in Solomon et al.
(1997).
The typical 13 CO/C18 O line ratio observed in local spiral disks is approximately 7–10 (JiménezDonaire et al., 2017). In contrast, we measure 13 CO/C18 O = 1.6 ± 0.1, consistent with the line
ratios of close to unity observed by Zhang et al. (2018b) in four lensed SMGs at z = 2.3–3.1, in
the ‘Cosmic Eyelash’ at z = 2.3 (Danielson et al., 2013) as well as local ultraluminous systems
such as Arp 220 and Mrk 231 (Brown and Wilson, 2019).

4.4

Interpretation and discussion

Before discussing the various effects which could affect the observed ratio it is worth briefly
discussing our use of a mid-J (5-4) transitions instead of a lower-J transition (where 1-0 is the
gold standard) which are typically employed, and some assumptions which may bias the results.
As mid-J lines have higher critical densities, this means that the bulk of their emissions arise
from denser parts of the ISM, which will miss a large fraction of the total CO masses within the
ISM. When converting from a higher J transition, you must use a conversion factor to convert
this into an equivalent 1-0 luminosity which can then be used to obtain a total mass within
the ISM. This conversion factor will vary with the transition and between galaxies due to the
different distributions of gas densities within, as well as the excitation conditions of the gas. As
we are using the line ratio of 13 CO/C1 8O and assume that the conditions in which C1 8O and
13 CO find themselves are the same and that 13 CO is not significantly optically thick, such that

the 5-4 and 1-0 ratios will be approximately the same.
Perhaps the biggest limitation of this work, is our use of an integrated flux measurement. We
assume in this work that the integrated ratio approximately matches the underlying molecular ratio, the CO emission in this integrated value will arise from many regions of the galaxy covering
a range of densities, excitations, and levels of gas processing. Martı́n et al. (2019) argued using

Chapter 4. 13 CO/C18 O in a hyperluminous galaxy

73

resolved 13 CO and C18 O measurements of NGC 253 that the multicomponent nature of the CO
emission and optical depth effects could complicate the interpretation of integrated results.
In the following section we discuss a range of effects that could also effect the derived ratio.

4.4.1

Factors affecting the isotopologue ratio

There are several factors that could affect the observed isotopologue ratio. First, we consider line
opacity. The CO isotopologues are usually assumed to be optically thin, but if 13 CO is optically
thick, this would of course affect the observed ratio. Zhang et al. (2018b) showed that even
for modest 13 CO optical depths, τ ∼ 0.3–0.5, under local thermal equilibrium (LTE) conditions
13 CO/C18 O would only vary by 10–20 per cent. An observed line ratio of approximately unity

would then require extreme column densities, N(H2 ) ≳ 1025 cm−2 . Whilst extreme, densities
approaching this may be present within SMGs, taking a simple model of an edge on homogenous
disc of gas, of constant scale height h and radius r, the column density of gas would be given by
MH2
10
mH rh , taking the gas mass to be MH2 ≈ 10 M⊙ , r = 3kpc and the scale height h = 1kpc, one

would obtain a column density of NH2 ≈ 1024 cm−2 , requiring an overdensity of approximately
10 to produce the densities required for this optical depth. However considering the 12 CO/13 CO
abundance ratio in the Milky Way (12 CO/13 CO ≈ 70), Zhang et al. (2018b) showed that the
12 CO/13 CO ratio approaches unity before the 13 CO/C18 O ratio, meaning that it is difficult to

attribute a low 13 CO/C18 O to optical depth effects since it would then be hard to explain the high
observed 12 CO/13 CO ratio. We therefore argue that the low 13 CO/C18 O relative the the Milky
Way is not due to optical depth effects, however 1 3CO could still be moderately optically thick
and the optical depth effects have to be considered with respect to the various IMF predictions.
For example as can be seen from figure 4.5 the predicted ratio from a K2.3 IMF lay between
5 ≳13 CO/C18 O≳ 1.5, for the various models. In this case a moderate optical depth on 13 CO as
described above could potentially explain the difference between the predicted ratio and that
of the Zhang et al. (2018b) average. We note that to assess the effects of optical depth in
full will require further observations of multiple CO transitions, along with the corresponding
isotopologues.
Next, we explore if photochemical effects can explain the observed ratio. For the rarer isotopologues, preferential photodissociation can occur due to a lack of self-shielding, i.e. a larger
fraction of 13 CO and C18 O molecules are exposed to the local UV radiation field and are therefore more susceptible to destruction (Visser et al., 2009). However, if the intrinsic abundance

Chapter 4. 13 CO/C18 O in a hyperluminous galaxy

74

ratio of 13 C/18 O ≥ 1 (and so 13 CO/C18 O ≥ 1) then preferential photodissociation would tend to
destroy C18 O at a higher rate than 13 CO, leading to a higher observed 13 CO/C18 O. It is unlikely,
therefore, that preferential photodissociation can explain the low observed 13 CO/C18 O line ratio,
as argued by Romano et al. (2017) and Sliwa et al. (2017).
Chemical fractionation can occur in cold environments where ion-molecule chemistry dominates, and could also impact 13 CO/C18 O. This process could lead to enhanced production of
13 CO due to the reaction 13 C+ + 12 CO ⇌ 12 C+ + 13 CO + ∆E, where ∆E = 35 K (Jiménez-

Donaire et al., 2017). The analogous reaction for oxygen, 18 O+ + C18 O ⇌ 16 O+ + C18 O has
an activation energy barrier which is not favoured under normal conditions (Watson, 1978) and
this reaction can therefore be ignored. The implication is that chemical fractionation would
lead to preferential production of 13 CO with respect to C18 O, where the opposite would be
required to explain low values of 13 CO/C18 O. Furthermore, for kinetic temperatures of order
Tkin ≈ 20–30 K, consistent with the bulk of the molecular gas in SMGs and ULIRGs (e.g. Dunne
et al., 2022), the 13 CO reaction would be just as likely in both the forward and backward directions. Again, we argue that 13 CO should not be produced preferentially in SMGs or other
intensely star-forming galaxies.
Having established that radiative transfer effects and ISM photochemical processes are unlikely
to drive 13 CO/C18 O down in SMGs, we turn to stellar nucleosynthesis, as argued by Zhang et al.
(2018b). Since 18 O is formed primarily in massive stars (≥ 8 M⊙ ) while 13 C is formed mainly as
a secondary element in intermediate-mass stars (≤ 8 M⊙ ), the ratio of these CO isotopologues
will naturally be sensitive to the IMF, however the details of the history of the chemical evolution
of the ISM is also clearly important and must be taken into consideration. Next, we explore
predictions for 13 CO/C18 O using a state-of-the-art chemical evolution model.

4.4.2

Galactic chemical evolution model

Our galactic chemical evolution (GCE) code is described in Kobayashi et al. (2000), hereafter
K20, and combining with the latest nucleosynthesis yields it is possible to reproduce the observed elemental abundances in the solar neighbourhood. Fig. 4.3 shows the evolution of [O/Fe]
and [C/Fe] ratios in the gas phase, comparing to the observations of stars that were born at
various ages and metallicities. The star formation history in the model is constrained from independent observational constraints, namely the metallicity distribution function (see Figure 1 of
K20). The K20 model can accurately reproduce the observed [O/Fe]–[Fe/H] relation, although

in Zhao et al. (2016a). Note the [X/Y] notation corresponds to a log relation [X/Y]
≡ log10 (X/Y ) − log10 (X/Y )⊙ , where X/Y is the ratio of abundances by mass.

Chapter 4. 13 CO/C18 O in a hyperluminous galaxy

[C/Fe] ratios at high metallicities are underproduced in the model, indicating extra production
from Wolf–Rayet stars. This model can also reproduce isotopic ratios (see Figure 31 of K20),
except for the over-production of 17 O from AGB stars (Kobayashi et al., 2011). Fig. 4.4 shows
the evolution of isotopic ratios for C and O. The 13 C/18 O ratio is low at the onset of galaxy
formation, and increases via the production of 13 C from intermediate-mass stars. Then the ratio
gradually decreases as more 18 O is produced from more metal-rich, massive stars.
The evolutionary tracks of isotopic ratios can be completely different if the rotation of stars is important. Stellar rotation has been considered in previous works (e.g. Meynet and Maeder, 1997;
Hirschi, 2007) but only Limongi and Chieffi (2018) have provided nucleosynthesis yields with
their stellar evolution and explosion code for a wide range of parameters including stellar rotation. As shown in previous works (e.g. Kobayashi et al., 2011), elemental abundances and isotopic ratios depend on the assumed stellar rotation. If all stars rotate rapidly (150–300 km s−1 ),
13 C/18 O stays low for longer and increases sharply after the formation epoch of the Sun (Ro-

mano et al., 2019). This trend can explain the high 13 CO/C18 O observed in the local ISM at the
present day. In this paper, when we consider rotation, we adopt 300 km s−1 for all stars, independent of metallicity. Note that constant rotation models over-produce O and C (Figure 4.3).
The match to observational data improves if some of the stars do not rotate, namely those at
high metallicities (see e.g. Prantzos et al., 2018), but 13 C/18 O does not then increase as much as
observed.
Our GCE code can reproduce the results with no rotation or constant rotational velocity in
Romano et al. (2019, their MWG08–10), as well as the velocity distribution in Prantzos et al.
(2018). Note that the isotopic ratios are very sensitive to the metallicity of progenitor stars,
but the metallicity grid of Limongi and Chieffi (2018) is too coarse. Where Romano et al.
(2019) interpolate linearly between contiguous grids, such that the adopted yields are Solar only
when the predicted Z is equal to Z⊙ , we instead adopt Solar metallicity yields at Z ≥ 0.004 and
extrapolate them at Z > Z⊙ . This problem was not apparent in Romano et al. (2019), which
is likely because they used the Talbot and Arnett (1973) and Portinari et al. (1998) production
matrix to scale the yields with metallicity where the grids provided by full computations are
missing. This matrix is valid for secondary element such as 14 N, but probably not for primary
production of 13 C, 14 N and 18 O in the case with rotation.

Chemical evolution scenarios for 9io9

We now compare our observational results to the predictions of the K20 model, for several
different scenarios. As described above, the model predicts the time evolution of the abundances
of isotopes (e.g. 12 C, 13 C, 16 O and 18 O) in a system that is instantaneously mixed, with a given
star-formation history and assumed IMF, and where chemical enrichment is from stars across
a wide range of stellar mass, including asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars, super-AGB stars,
core-collapse supernovae and Wolf-Rayet stars.

Our fiducial model assumes a Kroupa (K2.3 ) IMF (Kroupa et al., 1993; Kroupa, 2001, 2008)
with a three-part power-law function, where α0 = 0.3 at 0.01 ≤ M/M⊙ < 0.08, α1 = 1.3 at
0.08 ≤ M/M⊙ < 0.5 and α2 = 2.3 at 0.5 ≤ M/M⊙ ≤ 120, as in Kobayashi et al. (2020). For
the Solar neighbourhood, this model can reproduce the results of Romano et al. (2019) if we use
the same yields and IMF. We find that α2 = 2.3 gives a better match to the observed elemental
abundances than α2 = 2.7, where α2 = 2.7, noting that Romano et al. (2017, 2019) used α2 = 2.7
at 1 ≤ M/M⊙ < 100 which results in different metallicities and elemental abundance ratios,
even with the same star formation history. Furthermore, α2 = 2.3 agrees with the observations
of individual stars in the Solar neighbourhood for most of elements (except for Ti) with the K20
yields.
For AGB and super-AGB stars, the nucleosynthesis yields are taken from K20. For pre-supernova
and core-collapse supernovae, yields are taken from Limongi and Chieffi (2018) (set ‘R’), so that
we can test the impact of stellar rotation. For the relevant isotopes, half of the 12 C is produced
by low-mass stars (1–4 M⊙ ) and the rest from massive stars (M > 10 M⊙ ). 13 C is synthesised by
proton-capture at high temperature in intermediate-mass stars (4–7 M⊙ , hot bottom burning) and
massive stars, together with 14 N. 16 O is mainly produced during hydrostatic burning in massive
stars and is ejected via supernovae, while 18 O is synthesised by helium burning in massive stars,
depending on the metallicity and rotation (Kobayashi et al., 2011). In this paper, the rotational
velocity is set to 300 km s−1 at 13–120 M⊙ .
For our Solar neighborhood fiducial model, with a star-formation timescale of 4.7 Gyr and
infall timescale of 5 Gyr (see Kobayashi et al. 2000 for a detailed definition of the model
parameters; cf. 1 and 7 Gyr, respectively, in Romano et al. 2017, 2019), the isotopic mass
[number] ratios 4.57 Gyr ago are: 12 C/13 C = 163 [150], 16 O/17 O = 4, 644 [4, 371], which are
slightly higher than the Solar ratios (12 C⊙ /13 C⊙ = 90 [83] and 16 O⊙ /17 O⊙ = 2, 632 [2, 477]),
but 16 O/18 O = 419 [372] and 13 C/18 O = 1.16 [0.84] are in good agreement with the Solar ratios
(16 O⊙ /18 O⊙ = 496 [443], 13 C⊙ /18 O⊙ = 2.59 [1.87], Asplund et al. 2009). The Solar neighbourhood K20 model also predicts a very similar ratio of 13 C/18 O = 1.14, but predicts lower ratios
of 12 C/13 C and 16 O/17 O due to the lack of contributions from stars with M > 50 M⊙ and stellar
rotation. Note that for the yields taken from Nomoto et al. (2013), Romano et al. (2017) extrapolated1 over 40 < M/M⊙ < 100, which is not physically correct, whilst less than per cent of
the total mass is locked into such stars their metal contribution is significantly larger. 17 O yields
1 Nomoto et al. (2013) do not provide stellar yields for masses larger than 40 M , whereas Limongi and Chieffi

(2018) compute yields up to 120 M⊙ .

were set artificially to zero across 1 < M/M⊙ < 6 in Romano et al. (2017), which was fixed in
Romano et al. (2019), see Romano et al. (2020).
Having established this baseline, we construct a set of chemical evolution models for 9io9. This
galaxy has a gas fraction likely exceeding 50 per cent and a SFR, regardless of the assumed
IMF, of order 1000 M⊙ yr−1 . We do not have useful constraints on its star formation history,
given the lack of adequate photometry across the UV-optical-IR (exacerbated by its highly dust
attenuated SED). A secure redshift is measured from emission lines, and we postulate that the
galaxy cannot be much older than 2 Gyr. We assume 9io9 formed at z = 7 and consider a star
formation model that can be characterised by two time scales: τs , (equivalent to the inverse of
the efficiency) of exponentially declining star formation, and τi , of exponential infall of pristine
gas. We assume that the star formation history of 9io9 is characterised by an initial burst during
which a significant fraction of the stars are formed, followed by intermittent star formation such
that star formation stops when the (cold) gas fraction falls below 50 per cent and re-starts when
the gas fraction exceeds 50 per cent due to stellar mass loss or any late-phase gas accretion.
We consider two model sets, with stellar rotation and no stellar rotation, respectively. Each
model set is comprised of 108 star formation histories covering a mesh grid of τs = 0.1, 1, 2 Gyr,
for infall models with τi = 1, 2, 5, 10 Gyr or closed-box models (with an initial gas fraction of
unity). We also vary the high-mass IMF slope from α2 = 2.1 (top heavy), 2.3, 2.7 and 2.9
(bottom heavy), and also explore very slow star-formation models with τs = τi = 20 Gyr and
50 Gyr for the four IMFs under consideration. Clearly this is rather an exhaustive grid; only a
sub-set of models likely correspond to 9io9 and galaxies like it. However, in this work we aim to
illustrate the sensitivity of the prediction of 13 CO/C18 O for a fixed GCE model, not only varying
the IMF but also the impact of stellar rotation and star formation history. Fig. 4.5 compares the
predicted 13 CO/C18 O as a function of cosmic time for the different models. Note the different
y-axis ranges in each panel.
Let us first consider the models with bottom heavy α2 = 2.9 slopes. When stellar rotation is
included, 13 CO/C18 O is less than 0.3 for all star formation histories, with 13 CO/C18 O increasing
for shorter τs , and all inconsistent with the observations. Without stellar rotation, the same IMF
predicts high 13 CO/C18 O for all star formation histories, with 13 CO/C18 O above 7 within about
1 Gyr of formation, albeit with a larger spread in 13 CO/C18 O at late times.
For α2 = 2.7 – i.e. slightly less bottom heavy, and potentially close to Galactic (see below) – we
see a similar picture. In the rotating model 13 CO/C18 O stays low (<0.5) for all star formation

Chapter 4. 13 CO/C18 O in a hyperluminous galaxy

82

histories, with an identical trend with τs . When rotation is included, 13 CO/C18 O is even more
extreme, with 13 CO/C18 O exceeding 10 for all star formation histories after 1 Gyr. We conclude
> 2.7; the observed 13 CO/C18 O is
that the observations are inconsistent with an IMF of slope α2 ∼

of star formation histories.

13 CO/C18 O of order unity within a few Gyr for star formation histories with 100 Myr < τ <

1 Gyr. As τs increases, 13 CO/C18 O is suppressed at later times. The situation is reversed in
the non-rotating model, with 13 CO/C18 O rapidly increasing (exceeding unity, but not evolving
to the extreme 13 CO/C18 O seen in the rotating models) after formation for high values of τs .
< 1 Gyr these non-rotating models can re-produce the observed
< τs ∼
However, again for 100 Myr ∼
13 CO/C18 O on realistic time scales, even though the detailed evolution of 13 CO/C18 O is different

to the rotating model. We can conclude that our GCE can reproduce the observed 13 CO/C18 O of
< 2.3 favoured. Bottom-heavy IMFs (α2 > 2.3) cannot produce
9io9 with IMFs with slopes α2 ∼

the observed 13 CO/C18 O regardless of star formation history or the presence of rotating stars.
Also note how the inclusion of rotation has a significant effect on the ratios, primarily by inverting the IMF—CO ratio relation. This is due to the production of 13 C no longer being limited to
intermediate-mass stars, with a separate production route also being present in the more massive
Wolf-Rayet population.
There are a few reasons both direct and indirect, as to why stellar rotation has such a significant
effect on the resultant stellar yields. Stellar rotation causes mixing within stellar layers, this has
the effect of bringing different nuclear species into contact with each other, where in the absence
of rotation they would have remained well separated. Other effects of stellar rotation is that it
alters the size of the various convective regions within a star, as well as its surface properties.
This alters the future evolution of the star, with the latter causing more significantly more mass
loss than would be expected in the non rotation case, thus changing the conditions in which the
nucleosynthesis is occurring (Prantzos et al., 2018).
An important diagnostic tool tool to further differentiate the models comes from their metallicities. Figure 4.6, shows the metallicity evolution for each of our models. As one would expect,
the more top heavy IMFs due to their higher fraction of massive stars produce higher metallicities. What can also be seen is significant variation in the metallicity tracks based on the star
formation history and unlike the case of the C/O ratio, there is no inversion of the relation when

Chapter 4. 13 CO/C18 O in a hyperluminous galaxy

83

moving between the rotation and non-rotation model sets. The effects of stellar rotation in the
case of metallicity are more subtle, with the rotation model sets resulting in a higher metallicity than those without, given the same SFH and IMF. This effect is less pronounced than the
variation in metallicity from the variation in star formation history and τs , and thus a measure
of the metallicity in combination with the C/O ratio could be used in combination with the CO
isotopologues to provide further constraints on the range of acceptable models.

4.5

Conclusions

In debates around the possibility of non-universal IMFs, we usually refer to the Galactic IMF,
with terms like ‘top heavy’ and ‘bottom heavy’ relative to this reference. But what is the ‘canonical’ Milky Way-like IMF? In Zhang et al. (2018b), this is assumed to have a Kroupa form with
high-mass slope of α2 = 2.7 (Kroupa et al., 1993). However, (Kroupa, 2001) argue for the heavier α2 = 2.3. This discrepancy is due to different methods of constraining the IMF within the
Milky Way, with some authors arguing that a high-mass slope α2 > 2.3 is required to explain
the local field star IMF and chemical abundances (Scalo, 1986; Kroupa et al., 1993; Mor et al.,
2017; Jeřábková et al., 2018) while other approaches argue for a high-mass slope of α2 = 2.3
(Salpeter, 1955; Kroupa, 2001; Chabrier, 2003). Therefore we should conclude that, in the context of the discussion above, the IMF in 9io9 – a galaxy with a star formation rate up to three
orders of magnitude greater that the Milky Way – is consistent with a Galactic IMF only if the
latter is best represented by α2 ≈ 2.3 (Kroupa, 2001). Generally, IMFs more top heavier than
this are favoured, consistent with the conclusions of Zhang et al. (2018b).
Perhaps the most important conclusion we can draw from this study is the sensitivity of the
predicted 13 CO/C18 O ratio on the chemical evolution model. Figure 4.5 clearly illustrates the
profound impact the presence of rotating stars has for example: the differences in the evolutionary tract of 13 CO/C18 O for any given IMF is inverted when compared to the models without,
with the more top-heavy IMFs giving a higher predicted ratio. IMFs, where α2 ≥ 2.3, also
no longer show a well constrained predicted ratio, but instead vary by orders of magnitude,
with strong sensitivity to the SFH and star formation timescales. The more bottom-heavy IMFs
α2 ≤ 2.7, on the other hand remain tightly constrained but the resultant ratio is approximately
two orders of magnitude below that of the non-rotating case. This difference exceeds the effect

Chapter 4. 13 CO/C18 O in a hyperluminous galaxy

84

of IMF variation in the non-rotating case. The importance of stellar rotation on the ultimate enrichment within galaxies such as 9io9, could limit the ability to derive conclusions with respect
to the IMF based off of CO isotopologues.

Ongoing and Future Work
With a wealth of observatories covering much of the electromagnetic spectrum now online, it is
a golden age for astronomical data. In this section I will discuss some ongoing and future work
that can be done to help us better understand dusty star forming galaxies, with the main focus
being on 9io9, however much of this discussion can also be extended to other sources.

5.1

Ongoing Work: Spectral Scan of 9io9

As previously mentioned in Chapter 3 and 4, the observations described were collected as part
of a spectral scan. This spectral scan offered a wealth of data and molecular transitions, which
during the course of this thesis have yet to be explored. As such a brief discussion and outline
of the preliminary work on these and what they can tell us about 9io9 are warranted.

5.1.1

Water Lines

Water is one of the most abundant molecules and has some of the brightest emission lines in
the sub-mm bands, it owes this fact to containing two of the most common interstellar elements
in Hydrogen and Oxygen. Sub-mm wavelengths contain a plethora of water lines both paraand ortho- types, being observed in both emission and absorption. We have detected both the
557 GHz ground state o-H2 O emission and its isotopologue o-H18
2 O at 548 GHz. This line is
often observed in both emission and absorption, in the case of 9io9 we do not observe any
clear absorption with the line profile being consistent with the double horned profile of the CO
85

Chapter 5. Ongoing and Future Work

86

emission as well as other lines detected within this system (Geach et al., 2018; Harrington et al.,
2019).
Work by Liu et al. (2017) detected the ground state o-H2 O emission for a sample of star-forming
galaxies, with this sample they found a linear trend between the luminosity of the line and the
FIR luminosity (with a slope of N = 1.11 ± 0.21), 9io9 an intrinsic HyLIRG (LIR ≥ 1013 L⊙ ),
provides the brightest IR galaxy to contain a 557 GHz detection and potentially the first detection
of this transition in the high-z universe. Does 9io9 lay on the expected relation? Or is there
evidence of deviation from this relation? Whilst a proper analysis of the line is yet to be done
we tentatively find a line luminosity for the water line to be µLH2 O = 7.26 × 1011 K km s−1 pc2 ,
where µ is the magnification factor. With a already well constrained lens model we will be able
to de-lens the flux to the source plane to obtain a source plane luminosity.

5.1.2

Dense gas tracers: HNC and CN

To gain a full picture of the molecular gas within 9io9 requires observing a wide range of different tracers probing the gas across a range of density ranges and temperatures. Being amongst
the brightest emission lines in the mm/sub-mm range CO transitions are typically observed, due
to the extreme brightness of 9io9 we can go beyond this and start probing a variety of other
species tracing the dense gas.
With clear detections of both the HNC(6-5) and CN(5-4) emission lines and the lower J-transitions
HNC(5-4) and CN(4-3) detected in a previous ALMA cycle (Geach et al., 2018), we can now
start constraining the conditions of the dense gas within 9io9. These species were first detected
in the high-z universe in Guélin et al. (2007) where the blended HNC(5-4) and CN(4-3) were
detected, after decomposition they found that the HNC was the dominant emission with a luminosity ratio of approximately 2, though the CN was only tentatively detected. Other detections
of these lines by Béthermin et al. (2018) and Cañameras et al. (2021) find a dominant HNC
component consistent with Guélin et al. (2007). Geach et al. (2018) using the source plane reconstruction of the the same blended lines for 9io9, found that the CN emission dominated but
with significant redshift dependence on this.
Now with clear detections of the non blended higher transitions, we can now break this redshift
degeneracy. As can be seen in figure 5.2 each of the lines detected have the clear double horned
profile, similar to the CO emission, as such we can use the high S/N CO J(5→4) transition as

(2018), using the High S/N CO J(5→4) transition as a model to decompose the lines. The lower
panel is the resulting residuals from the decomposition.
an empirical template to decompose the CN/HNC emission. As we are using this empirical
template the redshift assumption is not required (though we do assume all the lines lie at the
same redshift) as the template is shifted by the ratio of the frequency of CO J(5→4) to target
line frequency, thus breaking the redshift degeneracy noted in Geach et al. (2018), by varying the
normalisation of this template for each of the lines independently we can determine best fit for
the contribution for each of the resulting lines. To determine the 1σ uncertainty on these fits we
add gaussian noise to each frequency channel determined by off source regions of the datacube
and scaled to match the subtending region. Doing this for 1000 realisations we obtain robust
uncertainties for each of the corresponding fits. As can be seen in Figure 5.1, the resulting
fit provides a good match to the observed line profile. Surprisingly the third CN component
is ∼ 5× the expected theoretical value, with Geach et al. (2018) interpreting this excess as a
potential outflow, however as seen in Figure 5.1 the location of this excess matches the expected
location of the third hyperfine structure emission peak.

Chapter 5. Ongoing and Future Work

88

F IGURE 5.2: Image plane emission of CN(5–4) and HNC(6–5)

Now with detections of a couple transitions for both species we can start to try and model the
conditions of the dense gas within 9io9. To do this we would use the program RADEX Tak et al.
(2007) via the python package ndradex, and this is work in progress.

5.1.3

N2 H+

The final transition of interest in this spectral scan is what we have tentatively identified as
N2 H+(5-4) (This feature can be seen in 4.1). N2 H+ is a tracer of the cosmic ray ionisation in UV
opaque and even X-ray opaque regions, and being an ion of similar structure, chemical origin
and excitation conditions is thought to originate in similar regions and trace similar structures to
the more commonly detected HCO+ (Ceccarelli et al., 2014; Gaches et al., 2019).
Cosmic rays heat the gas within galaxies and are a driver of interstellar chemistry (Dalgarno,
2006), so constraining their importance within a galaxy could have important implications on
our understanding of the conditions and chemistry present in high-z star forming systems in
comparison to local analogues.

Future Work

5.2.1

ALMA: High Resolution Imaging

89

On top of existing data to constrain conditions, a natural next step for work on 9io9 would be to
obtain higher resolution observations. Due to its lensed nature it provides a perfect opportunity
to study high-z star formation on scales otherwise unobtainable. Our previous observations have
been limited to approximately 300mas, corresponding to around 300pc in the source plane, by
further increasing this to around 50mas, which is in reach of ALMA, would allow us to probe the
conditions and star formation on scales comparable to that of giant molecular clouds (GMCs)
within 9io9. Setting up the observations such that important tracers of the ISM lay within the
observations, could allow us to both the dust and gas on these scales and below (combined with
previous observations) are a few of the questions that this sort of observations could help us
address, including the CI (2→1) and CO J(7→6) in our set-up:

• Dust morphology at the scale of star formation: Measure the thermal dust emission to
high significance probing the structure of the gas disk and star formation down to scales of
100 pc in the source plane, approaching the scales of GMCs. Is there evidence of clumps?,
or is star formation smoothly distributed at 100 pc scales?
• Resolving molecular disk structure: Map both the CO J(7→6) and CI (2→1) emission
across 9io9 to the same resolution as the dust. This would allow us to probe the distribution of both the star forming gas and the total molecular gas within 9io9, map any
variation between the dust continuum and molecular gas across the source, as well as better constrain the kinematic model and be able to measure the Toomre Q parameter across
the source to probe the level of disk instability. What is the level of dynamical instability
in the gas-rich disk?; Is there evidence of minor mergers driving activity?
• Lensing halo sub-structure: The high-resolution data would also allow us to probe the
sub-structure of the foreground lens galaxies in greater detail, as the lensing substructure leaves imprints on the shape and structure of the lens itself. Via sophisticated lens
modelling coupled with high resolution data we can tease out this structure. What is the
distribution of the dark matter sub-structure in the lensing halo?

• Mapping Kinetic temperature and gas mass: In combination with the previously detected C I (1–0) (at a resolution of ∼ 300mas) we would be able to map the kinetic temperature of the emitting gas on scales of ∼ 300pc, allowing us to probe both the conditions
and distribution of the total molecular gas reservoir across 9io9. Is there significant variation in the gas conditions across 9io9; Is the central AGN heating the gas in the galactic
centre?

James Webb Space Telescope

With the advent of the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), which launched on Christmas Day
2021, has allowed the most sensitive observations of the sky in the infrared. With its resolution
and sensitivity, JWST allows previous tracers and diagnostics to be explored on scales previously
unobtainable for sources at high-z. Here I will briefly discuss a potential avenue for research in
furthering our understanding of 9io9.

5.2.2.1

Mid-Infrared Instrument

One such avenue of research, would utilise the mid-infrared instrument (MIRI) on JWST. MIRI
covers the wavelength range 5 − 28µm, which at 9io9’s redshift (z = 2.56) covers many polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) transition features. Many of these PAH features have been
shown to be good diagnostics of AGN activity within sources, with signatures from AGN dominated regions, and that of star formation dominated regions can be easily differentiated based
off the lines equivalent widths. (Imanishi et al., 2010; Yamada et al., 2013; Inami et al., 2018).
Recent work on a lensed SMG presented in Spilker et al. (2023) looked at the 3.3µm PAH feature, which depending on its equivalent width can classify sources into Star-forming dominated
or AGN dominated. In this work they found an equivalent width of 125 ± 15nm far larger than
that expected for AGN dominated emission and thus supporting the conclusion that much of the
emission in this source is dominated by star formation.
For 9io9 in which there is some tentative evidence of AGN activity from the blended dense gas
tracers, CN and HNC (Geach et al., 2018), as well as the high radio-LIR ratio, which was found
to be higher than that expected from pure star formation. This technique would be invaluable in
helping confirm/disconfirm the influence of this AGN and its importance in future interpretations
of the FIR emission and diagnostics.

Building up a sample

The spectral scan of 9io9 as mentioned detected a wealth of species, that can be seen in figure 4.2. The main goals of my research plan would be to obtain spectral scans targeting the
same restframe frequencies. The restframe frequency range which is between approximately
540 − 580GHz has remained relatively unexplored due to the atmosphere being opaque to these
frequencies, thus local exploration has been limited to space observatories such as the Herschel
and Odin satellites, both of which are now offline. Due to SMGs laying at redshifts > 1, these
frequencies have been redshifted into regions of the atmosphere which are more transparent and
within reach of observatories such as ALMA. This provides a rare opportunity in which high-z
studies can provide insights beyond that of local studies.
Fortuitously the spectral range of interest has also covered in the spectral stack of 22 SMGs first
published in Spilker et al. (2014), with the final complete stack containing 78 sources presented
in Reuter et al. (2023). Whilst all the sources did not cover the whole range of the stack ≈ 30
sources were included over the region of interest between νrest = 540 − 580GHz. This allows it
to be compared directly with the 9io9 spectra and as such provide a reference frame for which
lines could be of interest in follow-up targeting. Figure 4 in Reuter et al. (2023) shows the
result of their stack, by comparison to 9io9 it can be seen that there are significant differences
in the result of the stack and our observed spectra. Whilst spectral stacks have great utility there
are complications in interpreting various line strengths and line ratios, due to a wide range of
sources of different SFR and evolutionary histories being included, which could have a spread
of line ratios involved. As such are not a perfect replacement for high sensitivity observations
of a range of sources, to examine the rich diversity of galaxy populations. Due to the intrinsic
faintness of the lines of interest(> 10% the neighbouring CO(5-4)), their study is limited to a
small sample of the SMG population, namely lensed sources. By utilizing gravitational lensing,
these transitions are detectable with ALMA with a few hours of integration time per source,
instead of a few days in the unlensed case. Table 5.1 gives the preliminary sample of targets of
interest, four of which come from the SPT sample (Vieira et al. 2013) with the final being that of
SDP.81 one of the most studied SMGs in the literature. These sources cover a range of redshifts
and intrinsic IR luminosities.

Concluding Remarks

Over the past century since the first discovery of external galaxies, our understanding of galaxy
formation and evolution has come a long way. We have broadened our view from the optical to
cover the whole range of the electromagnetic spectrum and now beyond into the age of multimessenger astronomy. What has become clear is that there exists huge diversity in the population
of galaxies both in the local universe and through cosmic time, to truly understand the physical
processes which drive the formation and evolution of galaxies requires a diverse approach both
using large samples of galaxies, probing the statistical properties of various galaxy groups, and
that of more in depth studies of a smaller number, trying to understand the specific evolutionary
path and conditions which led to specific galaxies outcomes.
How does 9io9 and the work presented in this thesis fit into this ever growing picture of galaxy
evolution, both amongst ULIRGs/HyLIRGs and that of the more general galaxy population?
Chapter 2 focuses on the ionised ISM, up til now few studies on SMGs have focused on the
density of this important component, through tracers such as the [N II] doublet. We found
that the ionised ISM, just like the molecular ISM is significantly denser than that of normal
star forming galaxies such as our Milky Way, with a derived density approximately an order of
magnitude above and consistent with that of a galactic star formation region. In chapter 3, we
again found similarity between that of galactic star forming regions and that of the integrated
values found within 9io9, this similarity found via the ground state Ammonia transition, likely
traces some of the densest gas within galaxies. These similarities between that of star forming
regions within the Milky Way and that of the most prolific star forming galaxies could show that
much of the star formation occurring in galaxies like ULIRGs is not that different form that of
other galaxies, but that they are able to sustain this star formation across much of their extent.
In recent years the CO isotopologues 13 CO and C18 O, have been argued to provide evidence
that in extreme starbursts such as 9io9 and more generally the ULIRG population, must be top

heavy. This result would have far reaching implications, due to the centrality of the IMF in
deriving many important galactic properties such as stellar masses and Star formation rates.
Evidence of IMF variation, would lead to more suble effects on galaxies as well, for example
by changing the expected supernova rates and thus the efficiency of stellar feedback, or the level
of enrichment with heavier elements in galaxies. Even if the evidence first arises in extreme
systems such as 9io9 it opens up a range of questions for the wider galaxy populaton, If the IMF
varies, by how much does it vary? Does it vary by galaxy type? does it vary within galaxies?. In
Chapter 4 by using a range of star formation histories, IMFs, and the effects of stellar rotation
to probe the resultant ratio we found that the importance of stellar rotation can not be ignored,
and has a huge effect on the result. In the cases of α2 = 2.7 and α2 = 2.9 the effect of stellar
rotation has a larger effect on the ratio than that of varying the IMF in the non-rotation case.
For α2 = 2.3 and α2 = 2.1, stellar rotation causes the ratio to be sensitive to the star formation
histories, varying by orders of magnitude between models. If stellar rotation is important this
could have strong implications on whether CO isotopologues could be useful in constraining
the IMF. However we also found that in both the case of stellar rotation and without the most
commonly adopted IMF in deriving galaxy properties can reproduce the low ratio observed in
the wider ULIRG population in some of the models, such that if the ratio is indeed a probe of
othe IMF it does not provide reason strong reasons to revise our galactic properties for the most
extreme star forming environments.
The overall picture found within this thesis is that even in galaxies that are far from that of our
own, the differences between them could just be due to scale with the ULIRG/SMG populations
having conditions similar to regions found within our own galaxy but across much of its extent.
Whilst many questions surrounding galaxy formation and evolution remain unanswered, over
the past 25 years since the discovery of SMGs, much has been learnt about this special class of
galaxies. With JWST, ALMA, and a host of other observatories now operating or set to come
online in the coming years spanning much of the EM spectrum, the coming decades will almost
certainly be a fruitful time in furthering our understanding of SMGs and galaxies more generally.
